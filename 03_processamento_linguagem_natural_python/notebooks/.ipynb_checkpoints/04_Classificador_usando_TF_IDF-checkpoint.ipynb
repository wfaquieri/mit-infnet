(dr.) claw is supposed to be evil, not handsome and charming. why is rupert everet 'claw' anyway? were the writers on drugs when they wrote these scenes? it looks like they were (badly) lampooning robo cop, with the turning a man into a crime fighting android thing. i tried to get my money back but there was a policy where if i watch more than 30 minutes of a movie, you don't get a refund. i'm sorry i watched more than 30 minutes of that pile of crap. after i was told the no-refund policy, i decided to watch the rest of the hideous garbage called inspector gadget.\\n\",\n",
       " \"the premise of this movie is revealed on the dvd box. a textile worker develops a miracle fabric that doesn't degrade. but the movie fails to get on with it. instead it pads for 45 minutes, noodling around a preamble before he makes the big discovery. since audiences don't benefit much from seeing a whiz kid figuring things out, it's a strange choice: the movie has successfully been prevented from engaging any topic. once the fabric is discovered, the movie too rapidly establishes that both industry bigwigs, and blue-collar co-workers want the invention squelched, leaving the movie with just two flimsy movements; inventing the chemical, and running from oppressors.<br /><br />i can't understand why anyone would describe this as comedy. the tone isn't funny or comical. it's more like serious social criticism of the day: that capitalism warps both supply chains and production. which in turn prevents innovation from reaching and improving the world. yes, that's probably true, but without some toying with an attitude towards that fact, the movie is simply an earnest argument. you'll need an extremely broad definition of comedy to find any here.<br /><br />this is more like a british meet john doe (meet nigel doe ?).\\n\",\n",

in short, they keep the faith, and use and abuse overly-stylized action and bullet-time like it\\'s going out of style (and after this display, i\\'m hoping movie-goers and makers alike learn to appreciate subtlety and originality a bit more). more on that later. to not spoil anything, i will say no more than the promo material already did: neo is still trying to figure out the matrix, and he is looking for answers while trying to save the humans, and zion, all while baddies are going after him and his cohorts. the movie pretty much picks up where the last one left off.<br /><br />action: while martial arts action and gunplay peppered its predecessor in somewhat equal parts, this movie focuses much more on martial arts than gunplay, adding swords, sais, etc. to the mix. special effects are so often used and waved in the audience\\'s face that it becomes really tiresome. i\\'ve discussed this movie with friends and coworkers alike, and nearly all of them found some of the action sequences--especially the \"smith fight\" we all heard would be in the movie--to be too long and tedious. this is a huge red flag for action fans, because the end of an action sequence should either leave you wanting a slight bit more, or completely content with the awesomeness that just occured.<br /><br />these fights scenes do neither. they are over-stylized, over-the-top sequences that are wooden and uninspired. in the first movie, there was a real sense of desperation to some of the action, a sense that fighting was for survival, not just looking good (which i honestly don\\'t think they manage in reloaded anyway) in black and leather. go watch drunken master or iron monkey after this movie to remind yourself of what good fighting sequences are--you won\\'t regret it. in addition, the \"matrix abilities\" people have in reloaded is not consistent, and what they actually do is not consistent. the first movie had its inconsistencies here, but they weren\\'t too glaring--unlike reloaded.<br /><br />special effects are poured on and on and on. every little thing someone does, be it just jump, somersault, spin, and in many cases just pose, are<br /><br />slow-moed, bullet-timed, or over-accentuated by some sort of destruction. it\\'s evident the w bros had a ton of money to throw at this movie, and boy did they throw it, with no real restraint. sharp editors could have really helped this, but the first movie was such a hit that free reign was obviously given, which brings us to. . .<br /><br />character and dialogue: i have already more or less said the dialogue was tired and full of philosophical platitudes. actors can\\'t really bring a lot of depth to their character when the script and direction is shoving character progression audience\\'s face, or neglecting it altogether. the audience is at no time given nuance and substance so they can contemplate the character on their own.<br /><br />keanu\\'s acting performance is stiff at best. keanu is good at acting confused, and that\\'s about all he does in this film. he makes a decent attempt to show passion between neo and trinity, but it falls flat.<br /><br />lawrence tries to make morpheus everything from moses to henry v, and be as cool as a cat throughout. with the script he is provided, he makes a noble attempt, but it also falls flat.<br /><br />moss isn\\'t very believable either. her look of concern is always the same, much like keanu\\'s, and the chemistry isn\\'t there, although in their very physical scenes they fake it well enough.<br /><br />hugo once again brought his weird sense of being an agent program, but he too suffered from the script\\'s hand. i actually find him to be the most interesting character of the bunch, but instead of development they just make him an excuse for a huge, drawn out fight scene.<br /><br />all in all, this movie is beyond disappointing if you had good expectations, and on its own, as a stand-alone movie (which is not how it\\'s supposed to be taken), it\\'s still horrible. i don\\'t see the matrix as deep, but i at least see it as an enjoyable scifi romp that has some interesting ideas, good action, a few funny lines, and enough restrained symbolism and elusions to amuse the attentive. reloaded fails on all these counts, and i really hope the w bros will give us a better experience in the 3rd installment. granted, i don\\'t have a lot of hope left for that after this film.\\n',\n",

       " 'i was looking forward to seeing john carpenter\\'s episode in season 2 because his first, cigarette burns, was by far the best from season 1 (and i did like other episodes from that season). oh, how i was disappointed.<br /><br />in fairness to carpenter i think the primary problem with this episode was absolutely horrible writing. the characters, aside from the subject matter, seemed to behave and speak as though they were written for an episode of walker, texas ranger. the acting was bad, and i normally like ron perlman a lot, but i can only blame them so much because the writing was so horrible. i\\'m not going to try to guess what the writers were trying to do because that would be useless but it appeared as though they were trying to mix horror (obviously) with some form of social commentary on abortion and religion. in this case, not surprisingly, it seemed a chance to bash a certain variety or religious nuts as well as fanatical anti-abortionists. and i am in favor of both aims but it was done so horribly that i was embarrassed to watch characters act and speak with such stupid inconsistency. this failed totally to offer any worthwhile opinion on the subjects and the horror element failed as well alongside such inept writing.<br /><br />while i don\\'t think carpenter can be blamed for most of the badness here i will say he did choose to direct the teleplay and therefore has that to be held responsible for. there are a couple small bits that i found nice, hence the 2 stars i gave it.<br /><br />the actual gore and monster effects were good, but the cgi gore (two separate gunshots to the head) were so obviously inferior quality cgi they should\\'ve never been given the ok. i\\'m generally very critical of cgi but not because i have a problem with it in principle. i have a problem with the execution of it. the technology, while amazing in some respects, is not good enough to match \"real\" effects, whether they be miniatures or gore especially when it is supposed to match something organic and/or alive, and therefore shouldn\\'t be used until they are. cgi can be used well in small amounts or obviously if the whole film is animated.<br /><br />i\\'ll also take this opportunity to note that the show title, masters of horror, is a bad title to have. there simply aren\\'t many actual \"masters of horror\" around. maybe two or three. if the show were called \"tale of horror\" or something like that it would be fine. but as it stands the criteria for directing one of these episodes, and therefore being criticized for not being a \"master of horror\" is that they have directly at least one horror film in their career. and it didn\\'t even have to be a good one.\\n',\n",

(i know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he\\'s been there for a while.) the realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, i thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats. <br /><br />a minor quibble, though. this is truly an excellent movie. my only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where i think it would have been so much more impressive.<br /><br />9/10\\n',\n",

       " 'the name uwe boll is automatically linked to bad horror/cult cinema and every new movie he releases \\x96 which is about two, three per year \\x96 immediately always receives negative ratings and harsh criticism. you\\'re actually almost tempted to think this is just a contemporary hype. you know, like it\\'s popular to hate uwe boll whether you liked his movies or not. let me just assure you that this is not the case. uwe boll is a terrible writer/director and quite frankly a menace to the entire film-making industry. \"seed\" is another most unfortunate of proof that. in here, boll tries so desperately hard to come across as controversial and shocking that he overlooks numerous other elements that any movie essentially needs to exist, like a plot, a narrative structure, character development, tension building\\x85 \"seed\" is a hideous movie, full of gratuitous filth and incompetent padding footage. i once read that \"seed\" was uwe boll\\'s interpretation of the nowadays popular horror trend of torture porn flicks, but that\\'s not even close. the film inarguably does borrow some influences from \"saw\" and \"hostel\", but basically it\\'s just another umpteenth dull slasher with an indestructible killer and video game violence. <br /><br />the first 45 minutes of \"seed\" are beyond boring and actually just confirm all the obvious things you already knew were going to happen. for you see, boll was stupid enough to begin his film with a (hyper- fast) scrolling text explaining there\\'s a federal us law claiming that death row prisoners have to be set free if three attempts to electrocute them fail. so you know this will happen later on, but still the first three quarters are wasted on catching a serial killer and bringing him to the electric chair. seed is a mute serial killer who supposedly slaughtered 666 victims (exaggerate much?) who wears a bag over his head. he watches real-life animal cruelty footage (and thus we watch real-life animal cruelty footage; thanks for that mr. boll) and videotapes people as the slowly decompose in their cellar (including a crying baby which is really sick and twisted). when he\\'s finally captured, during the most amateurish and implausible police manhunt ever filmed, and put on death row, the film even becomes more retarded. after being buried alive because the electric chair couldn\\'t fry him, max seed crawls back to the surface and goes on a brand new killing spree; this time mainly focusing on the people who arrested and executed him. <br /><br />the senseless plot twists and complete lack of story depth of this movie go way past being just bad; they\\'re downright infuriating and insulting the intelligence level of the average horror movie fanatic. multiple twists and sub plot in \"seed\" are simply impossible to accept by the reasonable functioning human mind because they\\'re just too dumb! nobody believes that cops and prison staff members will just bury a mass murderer alive without shooting a few bullets through his head first. nobody will accept that a fugitive convict cannot be found for another six months even though he went straight back to the exact same hideout place where they first caught him! \"seed\" is full of retarded little things like these and the movie gets dumber with each minute that passes. personally, i refuse to accept that the cast & crew members didn\\'t notice this as well. it really makes you think that uwe boll simply neglects all advice and criticism, and just stubbornly shoots his movies the way he wants to. i imagine his yelling stuff like \"shut up and do as you are told\" to his actors whenever they remark that the scene they\\'re shooting doesn\\'t make a lick of sense. <br /><br />just for the fun of upsetting people, there\\'s a gigantically overlong sequence where max seed smashes an elderly lady to death with a hammer whilst she\\'s tied up to a chair in the middle of her own living room. instead of shocking, as boll intended it to be, this sequence masterfully epitomizes how pathetic and wannabe controversial the whole film in fact is. \"seed\" is horrendous, it\\'s disgusting, it\\'s pitiable, it\\'s \\x85 boll.\\n',\n",

       " 'roman polanski is considered as one of the most important directors of our time, as the mind behind classics such as \"rosemary\\'s baby\" and \"chinatown\". probably what makes polanski\\'s cinema a very interesting one is the fact that while he is capable of creating commercially attractive films such as the afore mentioned masterpieces, he is also fond of making low-key movies that are of a more personal nature. \"le locataire\", or \"the tenant\", is one of those movies; a horror/suspense story about paranoia and obsession that is among his best works and probably among the best horror movies ever done.<br /><br />polanski himself plays telkovsky, a young man looking for an apartment in france. when he finally finds one, he discovers that it is empty because the previous tenant, simone choule, attempted to kill herself by jumping out of the window. after simone dies of the injuries, trelkovsky begins to become obsessed with her, to the point of believing that her death was caused by the rest of the tenants in the building.<br /><br />while sharing the same claustrophobic feeling of his other \"apartment-themed\" films (\"repulsion & \"rosemary\\'s baby\"); this film focuses on the bizarre conspiracy that may or may not be entirely in trelkovsky\\'s head, the catastrophic effects the paranoia has on his mind, and the bizarre obsession he has with the previous tenant.<br /><br />trelkovsky\\'s descend into darkness is portrayed perfectly by polanski. while at first his performance seems odd and wooden, slowly one finds out that polanski acts that way because trelkovsky is meant to be acted that way; as a simpleton with almost no life, who traps himself in this maddening sub-world that happens to be inhabited by a collection of bizarre people. the supporting actors really gave life to the people in the building creating memorable characters that are very important for the success of the film.<br /><br />also, the beautiful cinematography polanski employs in the film helps to increase the feeling of isolation, and gives life to the beautiful building that serves as cage for trelkovsky. the haunting images polanski uses to convey the feeling of confusion and madness are of a supernatural beauty that makes them both frightening and attractive.<br /><br />if a flaw is to be found in the film, is that it is definitely a bit slow at first. this may sound like a turn-off but in fact the slow pace of the beginning works perfectly as it mimics trelkovsky\\'s own boring life and how gradually he enters a different realm. also, the convoluted storyline is definitely not an easy one to understand due to the many complex layers it has. however, more than a flaw, it is a joy to face a thought-provoking plot like this one.<br /><br />while \"the tenant\" may not be for everyone, those interested in psychological horror and surreal story lines will be pleased by the experience. \"le locataire\" is really one of roman polanksi\\'s masterpieces. 10/10\\n',\n",

       " \"i'm a bit conflicted over this. the show is on one hand awful, the acting is terrible (even when we get actual name actors like brad pitt and bill moseley in one episode), the dialogue is moronic and the premise/moral of each episode feels like something lifted out of a 50s educational short. there's no way you'll be scared for a moment from any of these episodes, and robert englund's cameos are short, pointless and corny in a sort of a bob saget on america's funniest home videos kind of way.<br /><br />on the other hand this is one of the funniest things to ever be on television. the 80s fashions, the soft focus makes the actors look like their on the set of the view at all times, the premises lend the material more to self-parody than scares, so we're left with an episode where a high school kid is afraid if he fails his sat's his girlfriend will dump him and his parents disown him, another is afraid she'll be locked up in prison because she's a substandard mom (her husband is played by brad pit), another is afraid that all the parents in the world are in league against him when he runs away from home, another is afraid she'll be confused with her socially-retarded twin, another is afraid if he doesn't break up his mom and step-dad he'll get killed for having a party at his house. the list goes on and on.<br /><br />being that these are dreams i suppose you could look past the ludicrous plot points and devices, but they're so out of left field that there's no opportunities for the writers to actually scare the audience. you have characters dressed like something out of a 80s-themed nightmare wandering around delivering bad dialogue in very hammy fashion and making illogical decisions that serve no other purpose but to move the story to the next weird plot point (typically watching as a peripheral character does something uncharacteristic of a sane person while our main character stares aghast and too shocked to do anything about it).<br /><br />if you're looking for something that'll scare you stay away. if you're looking, on the other hand, for one of the funniest things to come out of the 80s ever. watch it.<br /><br />its been showing on chiller tv lately (pretty much every day) and i've been watching, earlier out of morbid curiosity, and now just so i can get a good laugh in each day. with arrested development and extras off the air this is officially the funniest thing on television right now.\\n\",\n",

       " 'i am not one of those people that will walk out of a movie that was based on source material and automatically say, \"the book was better.\" i know better than to demote the value of a movie just because it wasn\\'t a faithful adaptation. there is a lengthy process and lots of decisions that go into making a movie that are sometimes out of the director\\'s/editor\\'s/cinematographer\\'s/producer\\'s control and certainly out of the original author\\'s control. therefore, it is unreasonable to expect a movie to be exactly the same, word for word, as a book or play or video game or disneyland ride, or whatever! a movie should be judged on its own standard and how it fits in society. moreover, a successful movie should be made because the material is relevant to the society which it belongs and, if it is based on source material, its relevance needs to be reexamined and enhanced by the filmmakers. <br /><br />films like there will be blood follow this paradigm because while it was based on a novel written at the turn of the century, oil!, it feels relevant because of things like the iraq war and energy concerns that the film\\'s country of origin, the us, was and is experiencing. even king kong, based on the original film, benefits from using new technology and concerns of animal rights that people have.<br /><br />with that said, i just don\\'t understand why they even bothered to make this movie? besides the great performances, guaranteed oscar nods and shanley\\'s director/writers fee and royalties he will get, this movie seems to come from nowhere. it should have simply stayed as a play. the movie (which is essentially the same as the play) says nothing new about the reprehensible sexual atrocities committed and in many cases covered up by the catholic church here and abroad. it says nothing new or different than the original play. i can\\'t help but compare this movie to another movie that came out at around the same time: frost/nixon, which was also based on a play. frost/nixon, while about nixon\\'s regrets, seems relevant because it seems to have come at a time when president bush was about to leave office. the regrets that nixon had, as depicted in the play/movie, about the war and his presidency could just as easily reflected on bush and his presidency. in that respect frost/nixon seemed more relevant and actually benefited from a wider distribution via film because it got people talking and reflecting about the political status quo in the country at the time. in contrast, doubt felt like it was yesterday\\'s news and didn\\'t seem to offer anything that the play didn\\'t offer.<br /><br />of course the movie is \"good,\" the performances are outstanding, and the screenplay adaptation is apt, but so what? why didn\\'t it just stay as a play? why, besides marketing and financial reasons, make it into a movie? it gave audiences nothing new to discus about the awful subject.\\n',\n",

(you can shoot me, but i think the alcoholism, despite its urgency in many of the scenes, is a relatively small point about the film.)<br /><br />it\\'s a living, breathing thing, and it feels like a process: it could go any direction at any time. like \"taste of cherry,\" we are reminded that \"you must never forget this is only a play.\" yet it is dangerous: when rowlands says that line, is it great drama? how will the audience take it? is she being reflexive or does she just not care? her (character\\'s) breakdowns are incorporated into the performances, and ultimately the film, in such a way that it\\'s like witnessing a female james dean. 10/10\\n',\n",

       " 'i discovered this film after reading the book that inspired it. it is not a strictly biographical film; it is \"loosely based\" on the facts. but i found it a compelling and eerie exploration of evil and madness, and michel serrault gives an unforgettable performance as dr. petiot.<br /><br />there are many memorable images in this movie; petiot traveling through the night like a vampire, his black cloak flapping behind him, is almost iconic. there are also several touches of expressionism - petiot\\'s crooked silhouette mounting the stairs leading from the cellar where the butchered remains of his victims await cremation, reminds me of some scenes from \\'nosferatu\\'.<br /><br />but i found the primary appeal of this movie to be aural. the soundtrack is loaded with ominous sounds, starting with the foreboding music of the opening credits, accompanied by wordless wailing. petiot lives and runs his medical practice in a complex with many small shops, and there is a persistent background noise of knives being sharpened somewhere, as well as a peddler playing eerie tunes on a saw. there are animal noises as well - the concierge keeps a goat, unseen cats howl - and later in the film we see hapless cattle being herded through an underpass. the whole atmosphere is unsettling, with overtones of violence and slaughter.<br /><br />not only animals, but human voices are often heard - the screams of gestapo victims, petiot\\'s patients in his waiting room, monitored by a listening device, just the same as the suspected collaborators after the war are monitored in their cells. even the action of the film is often arranged so that we hear the voices of the participants without seeing them - when petiot goes to see mme kern, we hear her singing as she works, her voice echoing in the theater, before we ever see her. and even when she does appear, she is often filmed from behind, her voice calling out to her husband, whose voice calls out to her in conversation. disembodied voices echo in large halls, and their owners, when seen at all, are photographed at a distance, so we cannot actually see them speaking. this is a ghost story, and these are the voices of ghosts - many of them petiot\\'s future victims.<br /><br />yet petiot himself is often only a voice; his frightening laughter echoes as he retreats from the camera, throwing comments behind him or into the air to nobody. in a way, he is as much a ghost as those he murders. he is always frantically busy, scurrying from appointment to appointment, never at rest. but his activity is that of a machine - lifeless and imperturbable. it is interesting that among all the horror and danger of occupied paris, petiot alone is unafraid; he is amused, enthusiastic, angry, irritated, contemptuous, but never afraid, unlike those real people he lures to their deaths. it is no surprise that he boasts of his mechanical inventions, including a perpetual motion machine (a true detail from the book - he did claim to have invented many machines); he is a sort of perpetual motion machine himself. and mechanical imagery is everywhere in the film, from the opening giant wheel in the movie house, to petiot\\'s bicycle (with its squeaking wheels echoing the sound of sharpening knives), to the victrola he keeps winding up to play music before he makes a kill. even his routine with his victims is mechanical - write a note to your wife, let me disguise you before you leave, you need a vaccination, barcelona, casablanca, dakar - like a well-oiled machine, the routine is always the same, just as the record is always the same.<br /><br />maeder, the author, says that it was the clockwork perfection of his crimes that weighed so heavily against petiot at his trial. his system was as smooth and efficient as a nazi concentration camp, and this may be why the movie invents a subplot of petiot\\'s involvement with the french gestapo and the occupying nazis. unfortunately, it doesn\\'t quite work as part of the story, because it\\'s very hard to figure out just what petiot is doing for the collaborators, or what is going on when he ends up at their headquarters in the middle of the night. disposing of bodies? hiding stolen goods? it\\'s hard to say, and harder to believe; it\\'s not likely the state would turn to a freelancer like petiot.<br /><br />but it does remind us of the duality of evil people; petiot is a robber and a murderer, but he is also a devoted father and husband. just as we learned that hitler loved dogs, and that nazis guilty of the worst war crimes could also be loving fathers and family men, so we have to recognize that petiot could commit unspeakable horrors and yet also function normally. his insanity is easily camouflaged by the insanity and horror of the wartime situation in paris; when killing, robbing and disappearing are happening all around, nobody pays attention as petiot tosses more corpses on the pile.\\n',\n",

even a dumb waiter act as conduits for the flow of corrupt humanity. people cling to any niche that affords safety: moe has her grimy rented room, skip his tenebrous shack on the hudson river. as the characters move and interact, they are framed by bridge architecture, or lattices of girders, or are divided by hanging winch tackle. the personality of the city is constantly imposing itself. the angles and crossbeams of the wharf timbers are an echo of the gridiron street plan, and the card-index cabinets in the squadroom mimic the manhattan skyline. when joey\\'s exit from the subway is barred, it is as if the steel sinews of the city are ensnaring him.<br /><br />a surprising proportion of this film is shot in extreme close-up. character drives the plot, as it should, and the close-ups are used to augment character. when skip interrogates candy, the close-up captures the sexual energy between them, belying the hostility of skip\\'s words. jean peters\\' beauty is painted in light, in exquisite soft focus close-ups. the device is also employed to heighten the tension. the opening sequence, the purse snatch, contains no dialogue: the drama relies entirely on close-up for its powerful effect.<br /><br />snoopers, and snoopers upon snoopers, populate the film. moe (thelma ritter) makes a living as an informant, and her place in the hierarchy is accepted, even by her victims. when skip observes, \"she\\'s gotta eat\", he is chanting a recurring refrain. just as \\'straight\\' new yorkers peddle lamb chops or lumber, the underworld traffics in the commodity of information.<br /><br />and yet even the stool pigeons are superior to joey and his communist friends. joey\\'s feet on moe\\'s bed symbolise a transgression of the most basic moral code. joey is beyond the pale. moe will not trade with joey, even to preserve her life: \" ... even in our crummy business, you gotta draw the line somewhere.\"<br /><br />\"pick-up\" was made in the depths of the cold war. richard nixon had just been chosen as the republican vice-presidential candidate, having made his name with his phoney alger hiss expose - bogus communist microfilm and all. the mccarthy show trials were a daily reality. we see the cops in the movie inveigh against \"the traitors who gave stalin the a-bomb\".<br /><br />new york can be seen as a giant receptacle in which human offal cheats, squeals and murders. containers form a leitmotif throughout the film. moe carries her trade mark box of ties, and candy\\'s purse, container of the microfilm, is the engine of the plot. skip keeps his only possessions in a submerged crate, symbolising his secretive street-wisdom. the paupers\\' coffins, moving down the hudson on a barge, are containers of just one more cargo being shifted around the pitiless metropolis.<br /><br />the film is a masterpiece of composition. candy is shown above the skulking skip on the rickety gangway of the shack, signifying her moral ascendancy. when the gun is placed on the table, the extreme perspective makes it look bigger than candy - violence is beginning to dwarf compassion. the lovers are eclipsed by the shadow of a stevedore\\'s hook, reminding us that their love is neither pure nor absolute, but contingent upon the whims of the sinister city. enyard the communist is a shadow on a wall, or a disembodied puff of cigarette smoke. he is like the lone alley cat amongst the garbage - a predatory phantom of the night. camera shots from under taxi hoods, inside newspaper kiosks and through the bars of hospital beds constantly reinforce in us the awareness that we are all trapped in the metropolis. we are civilisation\\'s mulch.\\n',\n",

       " \"one of b- and c-movie producer roger corman's greatest cult classics was the ramones vehicle (originally designated for cheap trick), rock n' roll high school. it's just a simple, technically dated story (but would serve up extra doses of nostalgia humor considering these were the kind of things that made napoleon dynamite characters funny--see eaglebauer's van) about teenagers who love rock n' roll.<br /><br />students at vince lombardi high school are met with resistance by the evil principal, miss evelyn togar (played by cult classic favorite, mary woronov) who fears that rock n' roll turns kids into uncontrollable, amoral deviants and vows to make a rock n' roll-free zone. actually, she intends to wipe out rock n' roll for all students, regardless of whether its at school, and she has the cooperation of most of the adults who might make the plan successful.<br /><br />but not if riff randell (pj soles) can help it. a ramones fanatic, she has written some songs (including rock n' roll high school) that she wants to give to the ramones, and in trying to do so, is rebuffed by miss togar who does all she can to keep her from going to see the ramones play in town. it culminates into an ultimate revolt between the obsolete fun-hating adults and the teenagers (in an ending that is reminiscent of over the edge, somewhat). after the years of punk, when the fame of garage rockers, the ramones (and others) would mark another shift in music evolution, it was great to see a movie that celebrated the fun of it all and in such a humorous, exaggerated way.<br /><br />it is mostly mild comedy, but a great feel-good comedy nonetheless when you're in the mood for something more laid back to entertain you. with jerry zucker (of airplane fame) and joe dante (of gremlins fame) both taking part in some of the directing, you can get the idea for what kind of humor you're in for (and not to mention, expect to see dick miller even if only for a few minutes in the film's finale). the story must've later inspired (and was consequently updated) by the mid-90s comedy, detroit rock city, which some minor character changes in the vehicle for aged glam rockers, kizz.<br /><br />i would recommend passing on the corey feldman vehicle, rock n' roll high school forever, released nearly a decade later. the original is still the best.\\n\",\n",

       " 'i should say at the outset there are many, many things i love about \\'forbidden planet\\' and yes, i certainly consider it a \\'classic\\' science-fiction film for many reasons. but the adulation it has received over the years goes a bit over the top in my opinion. no less an authority than leonard maltin says \\'forbidden planet\\' \"...is one of the most ambitious and intelligent movies of its genre.\" ambitious? without a doubt. intelligent? depends on what part of the film you\\'re talking about. it certainly was the most prestigious and highly-budgeted science-fiction flick to that point. at a cost of nearly $2 million (this was 1956, remember), mgm pulled out all the stops to produce a dazzling, eye-popping outer space adventure unlike anything seen on the big screen before, even employing artists from the disney studio for some of the more elaborate special effects. \\'charming\\' is not usually a word used to describe special effects in sci-fi movies, yet that is the one that seems most appropriate here. even the dreaded \\'monster from the id\\' is only a well-rendered cartoon figure by the disney people, unlikely to frighten anyone over the age of 8. when i see the various sets and take note of the art design, models, costumes, etc., i am reminded of nothing so much as \\'the wizard of oz,\\' with its gorgeously saturated colors and elaborate if not always convincing effects. so much work has gone into these films that one is inclined to smile in admiration at the effort regardless. \\'forbidden planet\\' is wonderful to look at. the scenes take place on obvious stage sets that are fabulously decorated, matte paintings of planets and space in the background, and intricately designed miniature sand dunes and so forth to give the illusion of depth. it\\'s a bit like watching the most elaborately-produced stage play you\\'d ever see. the most believable and convincing scenes are probably the ones inside the massive krell complex, where shots showing the vast depth and width of this inner space are well-done and credible. but then we get to the actors, darn it. the performances are almost uniformly awful, though in fairness one has to say the dialogue hardly ever transcends the level of adolescent locker-room humor, except for some passages of barely adequate scientific technobabble. even the great actor walter pidgeon is reduced to giving such a hammy performance, it\\'s lugubrious at times. a very young leslie nielsen stars as the spaceship commander j.j. adams, and doesn\\'t convey an ounce of believability or conviction in the entire film. he seems to instinctively know, thirty years ahead of time, that his true forte\\' lay in comedy, as there are times he seems barely able to keep a straight face reciting his lines. every forced reaction, whether it is anger or passion or solemn meditation, looks right out of a high school play. anne francis, also very young, fares a little better as the supposedly innocent alta, whom we are to believe has never seen a human male other than her father until the crew of the spaceship shows up. (alta morbius, now there\\'s a name for you.) unfortunately, even at this early age, anne francis seems about as virginal and naive as elizabeth taylor in \\'butterfield 8.\\' there is a good story here, buried somewhere beneath the crew-mates\\' leering comments about alta and yet another juvenile subplot concerning earl holliman\\'s \\'cookie,\\' ship\\'s cook. (holliman turns in a horrendous performance too. i\\'m guessing all these actors went straight from this movie to acting school.) based on shakespeare\\'s \\'the tempest,\\' the story of a dead race, the krell, and the fantastic world of machines they left behind is what most people tend to remember about \\'forbidden planet,\\' and for good reason. for a few minutes here and there, you can forget about the rest of the movie and be dazzled by the disney artists\\' conception of the krell underground complex. is it enough to make up for the rest of the film\\'s shortcomings? you\\'ll have to decide that on your own. oh, and of course there\\'s robby the robot, every 1950\\'s ten-year-old\\'s idea of what a robot should look and talk like. he\\'s funny. in places. so, \\'forbidden planet\\' to me is a very, very mixed bag. it deserves credit for being the inspiration for a whole wave of sci-fi films and tv shows that followed, not least of which was \\'star trek.\\' but i would suggest that anyone who thinks it\\'s more than well-staged comic book sci-fi go back and watch it again.\\n',\n",

       " \"my comment is limited generally to the first season, 1959-60.<br /><br />this superb series was one of the first to be televised in color, and it was highly influential in persuading americans that they had to buy a color television set, which was about $800 in 1959, the equivalent of more than $3,000 today. how many of us would pay that much for the privilege of watching a show transmitted by a cathode ray picture tube on a 17-inch screen? i was eleven when the series began, and i watched it from the beginning.<br /><br />watching it now, 50 years later, several things come to mind. first, many of the story lines involve the comstock lode and the heyday of silver mining, which dates to 1859. for 1859, the weapons and clothes are, for the most part, not authentic. (the haircuts are left out of the discussion.) that's basically a nitpick.<br /><br />and, it would have been impossible for ben to have arrived in the lake tahoe area in 1839 and to have amassed a 100-square mile ranch in the next twenty years. pioneers were still trying to solve the sierra nevada problem as late as 1847, and the gold rush did not even begin until two years later.<br /><br />indians are not played by native american actors. john ford was using native american actors in the 1920s. the bonanza producers could have easily done so thirty years later. that is a major nitpick for me.<br /><br />there are other time-line problems. in season 1, mark twain appears, and he is depicted as a middle-aged man. mark twain was 24 years-old in 1859. the stories also vacillate between 1859-1860 (pre-civil war) and what was more suitable for an 1880 time-frame. there are continuity problems, over and over.<br /><br />it is somewhat off-putting, too, that there is so much killing in the first season. in time, the killing was reduced.<br /><br />many of the episodes take a socially liberal slant, which would be hard to believe, given the time-line, but give the writers credit for anticipating the seismic shifts in the nation's attitudes beginning in the 1960s.<br /><br />having said all that, the acting is good, and i have come to conclude in my latter years that adam's character was drawn better than any other's. i don't think pernell roberts ever got the credit he deserved. also, season 1 reinforces the fact that dan blocker (hoss) was a good actor.<br /><br />many of the stories trace real historical events. the guest stars were interesting.<br /><br />this was great family entertainment, and the series stands up very well by any measure.\\n\",\n",

       " 'we\\'re a long way from laura. once again otto preminger directs, dana andrews stars as a police detective named mark, and gene tierney is the beautiful woman who haunts him, but nothing else about where the sidewalk ends resembles everyone\\'s favorite sophisticated murder mystery. instead of deliciously quotable dialogue we get gritty, harrowing realism. while the earlier film took place in the ritzy upper echelons of new york society, here we\\'re in the low-rent district of dark streets, hoodlums, cheap restaurants and crummy flats. tierney, gorgeous as ever, now works as a department-store mannequin and lives in washington heights (the neighborhood of the \"doll\" who once got a fox fur out of laura\\'s mark mcpherson). this time andrews is mark dixon, an older, sadder, more troubled version of the cool cop in a trench coat. <br /><br />where the sidewalk ends belongs to a sub-genre of noir, movies about police brutality focusing on cops who can\\'t control their violent impulses. like kirk douglas\\'s character in detective story, dixon owes his seething contempt for crooks to his father\\'s criminal past. where douglas is self-righteous and blind to his own faults, andrews is burdened by repressed guilt and self-loathing. he accidentally kills a suspect and covers up his actions with an attempt to throw suspicion on a slimy gangster (gary merrill) whom he has been vainly pursuing for years. instead, a kindly cab driver is suspected because he\\'s the father of the dead man\\'s estranged and mistreated wife morgan (gene tierney). dixon, falling in love with the wife of the man he killed, tries desperately to save her father without giving himself away. <br /><br />among noir protagonists, dana andrews had this distinction: he was incapable of appearing unintelligent. even when playing an average joe, as he usually did, he always comes across as unusually sensitive and perceptive; more than that, his air of being too thoughtful for his own comfort gives him that haunted--and haunting--quality that was his essence as an actor. he played ordinary guys, cops and soldiers, but always with a tragic undercurrent of seeing and knowing too much. his conscientious heroes are marked by exhaustion, guilt, the inability ever to \"lighten up.\" no other actor could have expressed so well the bottled-up anger, the slow-burning pain, the agonized intelligence of mark dixon. he also has a muted tenderness, a muffled warmth and even wry humor that make him heartbreaking. this comes out when he takes morgan to a restaurant where he\\'s a regular, and for the first time we see this cold, brutal man trading mock insults with the waitress, whose sarcasm can\\'t hide her affection and concern for him. when dixon asks his partner for money to get a lawyer for morgan\\'s father, he supplies it even though they recently argued and dixon threw a punch at him. there are no words about loyalty or knowing he\\'s a good guy deep down, but we see it all in the man\\'s anguished silence and his wife\\'s resignation as she hands over some jewelry to pawn. dixon\\'s goodness comes across through other people\\'s reactions to him as much as through andrews\\'s deeply moving performance. <br /><br />though dana andrews was a minor star, he may be the quintessential forties man. he goes through some movies hardly ever taking off his overcoat; with that boxy, mid-century silhouette, further fortified by the fedora, the glass of bourbon, the cigarette he doesn\\'t take out of his mouth when he talks, he looks imprisoned in the masculine ideal of toughness and impassivity. while many noirs romanticize the two-fisted tough guy, where the sidewalk ends offers an unflinching portrait of the reality behind the façade, a gripping and melancholy exploration of the roots and consequences of violence.<br /><br />andrews was sadly underrated in his own time (he was the only one of the three protagonists in the best years of our lives not nominated for an academy award, though his low-key performance is far more compelling than frederic march\\'s hammy, oscar-winning drunk). fortunately, andrews appeared in some films that ensured his immortality, and now at last this little-known film, which contains his best performance, can be seen as part of the marvelous fox film noir set. this series, including a number of never before released titles (such as nightmare alley and thieves\\' highway), suggests that twentieth-century-fox may have had the finest record of all the major studios when it came to film noir.\\n',\n",

       " '\"angels in the outfield\" was originally a 1951 movie from the ted turner library; disney remade it in 1994, this time, using the california angels (now the los angeles angels) as the team (disney used to own this and the anaheim mighty ducks hockey team; also, good use of the words, huh?????).<br /><br />this movie was about a couple of orphaned children who wanted a family. a man promised the boys a family, only if the angels won the pennant. so, he called upon god one night about this. the boy who prayed could see the help coming on the way (and only that boy); for instance, when the first angel had come down, a player hit a ball so hard not only did the bat break, so did the ball!!!!! for much of the post-all star season of 1994, the angels were at the top of the al west (of which my home team the rangers is one and it still is). however, they lost a game because the boy was at court instead of the white sox/angels game (there was no central division in baseball back then, hence chicago being in the west), and no angels were there to help. thus, a new rule was created: no angels can help in championship games. but wait! in the final championship game, the angels won!!!!! it was a miracle indeed!<br /><br />what i liked about this film: this is a good movie. i mean, i prayed every night for the last few years asking for help with school and stuff; look at me now! my work was good!!!!! so for one, this shows that if you believe, god can send his angels down to help you with any troubles that you may have in life. and second, this is a family baseball movie, which is always exciting. this is an old disney movie, too; i\\'ve seen this just recently on the new disney channel (blech!!!!!).<br /><br />\"angels in the outfield\" will change your life forever once you\\'ve seen it!!!!!<br /><br />10/10\\n',\n",

       " 'all of the people reviewing this film, and probably many professional film reviewers, just don\\'t get it. this film was made with matting sequences and art techniques quite like the works of the great czech filmmaker, karel zeman. if you want to know what i\\'m talking about, i suggest you get any of zeman\\'s films, such as the fabulous world of jules verne, baron munchausen, journey to the beginning of time, or on the comet. if you are unable to locate a film, then read the reviews in amg. they will explain the processes used. if one were to look at zeman\\'s work and try to compare it to any of the other sci/fi fantasy films of the time, viewers probably wouldn\\'t have gotten it then either. it is unfair to compare either of these filmmakers\\' styles to the standard technologies of the day, because both zemen and hines \"do not compute\". they have a style that is unique to them and should be judged for their creativity only. if you look at this film from a perspective where you know that he intentionally tried to create a pastiche collage of mattes mixed with live action, you could easily come to the conclusion that he did a masterful job. it isn\\'t easy making a bunch of computer cutouts flow. i thought that the creatures were also quite good, also considering how they were made. hines took a great gamble, and i think his film will not be fairly judged for years to come. someone promoting the film should have tipped the audience off as to what they would be seeing, rather than let them blindly go into the theater expecting the usual cg work. regarding the actors, i think hines also took a page from zemen\\'s book, in that many of zemen\\'s actors were somewhat expressionless at first, but became much more engaging as the film and action went on. it is totally refreshing to me to have this movie in my library. i will watch it for years to come, all three great hours of it.\\n',\n",

       " 'before i begin, you need to know that i am a huge fan of many of sonny chiba\\'s films. his biographical series of the life of his master, mas oyama, were amazing and among the best martial arts films ever made, as were most of his street fighter films. the action was practically non-stop and with the possible exception of bruce lee (depending on who you ask), he was the greatest martial arts practitioner on film during the 1970s. because they are so good, i\\'ve seen at least 15 of his films and recently bought some more (which i am in the process of watching).<br /><br />unfortunately, despite my love of these films, i am not a mind-numbed zombie who worships the man to such a degree that i rate every film a 10. there are a few reviews like this here on imdb and i truly think that anyone giving this film a 10 should be ignored because this is such a bad film from a technical standpoint and isn\\'t even close to the being chiba\\'s best work. a score of 10 isn\\'t a real rating--it\\'s some zombie fan trying to make a statement about chiba, not this film! as i said, technically this film is awful. some of this was the result of my seeing the american dubbed version, with its irrelevant prologue and bad dubbing. but most of the problem would still exist with the original japanese print. the camera-work is simply atrocious--like it was done by chimps (smart chimps, but still chimps nonetheless). often, much of the fast martial arts action is missed because the camera is so slow or the tops of the actors heads are clipped off due to the shoddiness of production. and, again and again, the camera pans in and out like it is a new toy being used by an idiot plus the editing is beyond wretched--with cuts being done haphazardly and confusingly.<br /><br />i don\\'t know whether the musical score is original or not--but it was also very, very bad. sort of like acid rock of 1970 blended poorly with ennio morricone\\'s \"spaghetti western\" music--it was annoying, distracting and just plain silly.<br /><br />as for the martial arts action, i think that having chimps do the choreography would have improved things a bit. instead of the great fight scenes you\\'d look forward to in a chiba film, the fights are too brief and often missed by the camera!! so what you are left with is the story...and this might just be the worst part of the film! it\\'s supposed to be an anti-drug film starring sonny chiba as....sonny chiba! and when the film begins, he vows to destroy the drug trade in japan. but, the mafia (complete with not a single member who looks italian, but who are all japanese) vows to stop chiba. and, when a lady comes to chiba with promises to give him information about how to destroy the drug trade, he agrees to help her and risk his life with no conditions--even though she\\'s never forthright about telling him what she knows! in fact, later it turns out she is just trying to use chiba to protect her while she herself sells a huge briefcase full of cocaine--and he continues trying to protect her!! this makes no sense at all and throughout much of the film it looks as if they just shot the film without a script--such as when they went into the bars and brothels and had chiba walking about as if he was drunk.<br /><br />so if it was that bad, why still does it merit a 3? well, first, there are many more horrid marital arts films (such as many of those from hong kong in the 1970s)--including one with guys dressed up in gorilla suits doing kung fu and their handlers with 3 foot long tongues they used for fighting (now that\\'s bad). second, while the action is very bad compared to other sonny chiba films, compared to its contemporaries, it\\'s not that bad. still, you could easily do a lot better than this horrid little film.<br /><br />by the way, if you are wondering if this is the worst sonny chiba film, it certainly is not! in one of his first films, invasion of the neptune men, chiba plays a leotard-wearing super-hero who battles pointy-headed invaders from the planet neptune. it\\'s so bad that it rivals plan 9 from outer space and they saved hitler\\'s brain for awfulness.<br /><br />a final note to parents--like most of sonny chiba\\'s films, this one is very violent and has its share of boobies. don\\'t let little kids watch this no matter how much they beg! make them wait until they are older before you let them watch wretched rated-r martial arts films!\\n',\n",

       " 'to anyone who hasn\\'t seen this film yet, i have a friendly warning: don\\'t watch \"la casa dell\\'orco\" expecting any demons at all, because you won\\'t find them here. this film is not a third installment to the \"demons\" series and it has nothing to do with it whatsoever, except the fact that lamberto bava directed them. as a matter of fact, michele soavi\\'s \"the church\" is also known an unofficial \"demons 3\" and it\\'s a deceptive title in that case as well, so go figure. it is obvious that due to the \"demons\" films success; they tried to deceive the audience with misleading titles, even though it is obvious that this is a disconnected story. having said that, i think it\\'s unfair on the other hand, to say that \"la casa dell\\'orco\" is not worth the look. honestly, the movie is quite atmospheric and even though there are a few unintentionally hilarious situations, i thought it was genuinely creepy on the whole. nevertheless, i think it\\'s fair to say that the story somehow tries to emulate lucio fulci\\'s \"the house by the cemetery\". of course, that\\'s just a speculation i have, but i think i have my valid evidences. for instance, in both films, paolo marco is the man of the family, in both films, there\\'s an irritating little son named bobby, in both films, the woman of the house is a beautiful thirty-something, who seems to be the only one to see that there\\'s something really wrong in the new house, and in both films, there\\'s something really, really wrong going on in the basement. i\\'m sorry but i can relate both films very easily and i\\'m not saying that as an accusation. for the contrary, my point is that those who enjoyed \"the house by the cemetery\" are probably going to enjoy this movie as well, keeping in mind of course, that \"la casa dell\\'orco\" is far less pretentious, less scary, not nearly as atmospheric, but the formula is still there.<br /><br />in \"la casa dell\\'orco\", charel, her husband tom and their little son, bobby, go on a vacation trip to an old deserted castle, situated in the heart of an italian villa called trifiri. leaving aside the beauty of the place, shortly after their arrival, charel starts to have the feeling that she has been there before, which is impossible, considering that she had never been to trifiri before. sadly, charel can\\'t get over her déjà vu and the worst part is that her visions, come along with the image of a horrendous creature going after her. tom, who is not a very patient guy to begin with, advices her to leave the nonsensical hallucinations aside and enjoy the vacation. however, the woman\\'s visions become more and more real and the peace and quiet that they were supposed to enjoy, suddenly turn into a living nightmare. the old nightmare from charel\\'s childhood becomes real and this time, she won\\'t be able to escape without confronting that menacing ogre first.<br /><br />as it is expected, the plot somehow turns out to be a little bit simplistic and as a consequence, it is hard to fill an hour and a half. this means that \"la casa dell\\'orco\" offers more than a couple of sequences with nothing but total silence and the image of the main character, walking around the castle for several minutes, reviving the images of her childhood and nothing else. it gets rather tedious from time to time, but overall, it\\'s nothing serious. like many italian horror films that came out throughout the late eighties, this movie is pretty stylish and effective, but it also offers a nice variety of unintentionally funny moments, that make the movie unforgettable in a way. for instance, the part in which charel is brutally slapped by her husband and instead of going to her bedroom crying like i would have expected, she strikes back against him by punching him on the face really hard and running away to the woods like a maniac. the funniest thing however, is the fact that two minutes later, they\\'re a happy couple again, as if punching each other like that, was the most natural thing in the world. i know it\\'s silly, but i myself, found it absolutely hilarious. the ogre (which is obviously the villain of the story) looks creepy and funny at the same time too and let\\'s face it: a villain who can freak us out and make us laugh a little bit, it\\'s twice as welcomed. it reminded me of michael jackson in \"thriller\", but much more natural and human, of course. but if focusing on the genuinely good aspects that i mentioned before: the music composed by simon boswell is one of the high points and even if it pretty much always the same, it fits perfectly and it helps to create a rather dark atmosphere during the moments of tension. so if i have to give my final statement regarding this movie, i\\'m going to have to say that i can\\'t help loving it, including the small flaws and most people who enjoy these typical italian horror movies from the late eighties, won\\'t be disappointed by this one. it has all the typical and always well received clichés, like the crazy old man who actually speaks the truth, the foxy local woman who is said to be a witch, a creepy castle, a huge dark basement with a terrible secret and the local folks who try to prevent the tourist with their hostility, to stay away from the infamous lands. i would say that \"la casa dell\\'orco\" deserves two thumbs up and a punch at your spouse\\'s face, as a way to pay tribute to the heroine of the story. take this movie for what it is and enjoy it.\\n',\n",

       " 'i saw this movie, just now, not when it was released and hailed as best picture of the year here in israel. and to summarize everything right now, i will just say: this is not a good film.<br /><br />this is dror shaul\\'s second feature film, and i have to admit that his first and the tv drama he made before this picture are much better. further more, this is his first attempt at directing a drama. the early works were comedies, and were funny and effective.<br /><br />the first thing you have to know if you\\'ll ever see this film: israel of the 21st century hates the kibbutz and the values it represented since the formation of the state of israel. the real situation of the kibbutzim is very dire, and some of them disappear one by one. the kibbutz, hebrew word for collective, was a sort of village for members only, where the values of equality and socialism were the dogma for everyday life. with the change in social values with time, it seems now that the kibbutz was a place where the human spirit was repressed, locked within the dogma rules, with no ticket out. the entrance of capitalist values and way of life in the 90\\'s and so far made it very hard on the kibbutzim to survive. the crazy mother in the film is the central metaphor for that.<br /><br />but, i regard this film as having nothing to do with nostalgia for the good old days of the kibbutz. once, it was a dream of every young couple to live in a kibbutz and raise children in this quite and beautiful environment. but the film shows the opposite. that the kibbutz, with it\\'s socialist dogma, was a place sort of like a cult of crazy people, with crazy ideas that undermine the freedom of each individual within the collective. this is the central philosophy of post modern capitalism: your individuality is the most important thing. you must place yourself in the center, and no one else but you is the matter. this is the philosophy the film stands for, and that\\'s just it\\'s first sin.<br /><br />if you disagree with me on the political side, i\\'m sure you will agree that the acting, the tone of the film, it\\'s script and it\\'s direction are the four sins that follow. the film has no real visual text and none of it\\'s shots is something to remember. it is also very \"delicate\", a delicacy that is no more than artsy fartsy attempt to provoke emotions, which do not surface, not in the film and not with the viewer. it brings nothing but boredom.<br /><br />can someone please explain: why this film won so many prizes? maybe because it shows that israel is in line with the rest of the world, hating socialist and human values? or maybe it shows that israel is a \"delicate\" place, not giving in to dogmas and fanaticism? that we are basically very human and good people, capable of emotions, especially when they are fake ones, just like capitalism expects us to be? or maybe because it tells one of the biggest lies of israeli cinema in recent years, a lie that undermines the justification of the existence of the jewish state? no matter what the answer is, it\\'s not a good one. not for the world, not for human values and not for the jews.\\n',\n",

       " 'it was easy for sir richard attenborough to make gandhi (1982)\\x97he was merely narrating a story of a great individual who walked on this planet not so long ago. comparatively, it must have been a lot tougher for director feroz abbas khan making his debut as a filmmaker to make gandhi my father, pitting a shriveled anti-hero against an international hero, both of whom were historically real individuals, and ironically father and son. the events in the film are mostly real. mahatma gandhi lived as shown in the film, setting high moral standards for the world to follow. yet these very standards overshadowed the aspirations of his eldest son harilal to be a lawyer of repute like his father, to complete his education and get a job in india and thus provide income for his nuclear family.<br /><br />the film does not debunk gandhi and his ideals. for gandhi, his mission was larger than his family\\'s aspirations. he loved his family and cared for them, though his thoughts for their appeasement were blinkered by his ideal of caring for the masses. he stood for equality and dignity among all persons and in his view to give special undue advantages to his own son overlooking other deserving persons went against the basis of what he preached. the film looks at an unusual case of parenting\\x97where an idealist parent places receding goalposts for a less-than-brilliant offspring. <br /><br />the film presents an unusual scenario that happened. a son marries his childhood sweetheart, upsetting his father. the father upsets his son\\'s educational aspirations at several key junctures. the fragile link between a devoted son and a father breaks, as the son wants to stand on his own feet and care for his nuclear family. while the father gradually becomes the father of a nation, the son stumbles in valiant quest for identity and survival. his marriage breaks and seeks solace in religion, buffeting between islam and hinduism. through all his tribulations his link to his mother remains, until she chides him for being drunk.<br /><br />feroz khan is essentially a director of plays making his foray into cinema. he wrote and directed the play mahatma vs. gandhi that had considerable impact on the indian theater community. the play and the consequent film were based on two biographies, one by chandulal dalal and another by nilamben parekh, the success of the staged play was an evident reason for the commercial bollywood actor anil kapoor to produce this noteworthy film. every time a good director of plays attempts to direct cinema there is an evidence of a lack of confidence with the medium. peter brook is a great director of plays, but less competent as a film director. the opening shots of khan\\'s film promises great cinema\\x97a derelict harilal gandhi is brought to sion hospital, bombay (mumbai) barely mumbling that his father is bapu (the popular name of mahatma gandhi), father to an entire nation. the hospital authorities do not recognize him to be mahatma gandhi\\'s eldest son, dying in poverty and loneliness. apart from the dramatic opening, the film unfortunately merely presents a great story and some superb exterior shots of father and son meditating in silhouette. for an indian film it does present some high production qualities that go hand in hand with a lack of interest for details (the clothes of most indians in the film seem dust-free and freshly laundered, modern hairstyles of actors, and even shefali shetty playing mohandas gandhi\\'s wife a century ago with plucked eyebrows), the bane of indian cinema. since feroz khan is a theater personality, he has invested much more effort in working with the actors in developing the characters rather than on cinematic details, somewhat like sir attenborough another person who is also a product of theater (royal academy of dramatic arts).<br /><br />knowing quite well that to criticize gandhi in any manner was asking for trouble, even when there was no direct criticism in the film, producer anil kapoor took a remarkable decision of not putting up posters of the film at accessible heights in india, fearing that some one could tear the poster or disrespect it intentionally or unintentionally. <br /><br />with all its mix of greatness and faults, gandhi, my father throws several questions at the viewer. is a mother-son bonding stronger than a father-son bonding in parenting? is one\\'s immediate family less important than humanity at large? does one seek refuge in religion and alcohol only when worldly troubles are encountered? in this film, harilal buffeted by adversities runs from one religion to another, while his father quotes scriptures \"forgive them for they know not what they do\" when beaten and thrown on the ground by a south african policeman, convinced of the value of religion and convincing others as well.<br /><br />the film won the best actress award at the tokyo international film festival for shefali shetty (shah) and an indian award from critics. feroze khan and anil kapoor have handled a sensitive subject very well and elicited above-average performances from the ensemble of actors. i do hope the international success of the film paves the way for some able director to film another brilliant indian play girish karnad\\'s tughlaq some day meeting international quality standards.\\n',\n",

       " 'as a child i always hated being forced to sit through musicals. i never understood why people would break out into song like that, and i was far too young to appreciate the artistry (choreography, set design, costumes, pacing) behind it all. carol reed\\'s \"oliver!\" was the one musical i remember oddly enjoying as a child, probably because it is one of the darker ones and is appropriately drenched in the spirit of dickensian squalor. this is a musical about ghetto life in victorian london, and while the scenery and set designs are stark, dark, and true to that way of life, it is flat out bizarre for people to be breaking out into such ridiculous songs amidst their misery. upon a recent viewing, my first since childhood, i have some new thoughts and insights into why this musical \"works\" in that bizarre breaking out into song kind of way, and why most just don\\'t do it for me.<br /><br />when musicals work or really say something, it is because they realize their own inherent strangeness. lars von trier\\'s \"dancer in the dark\" as tragic and operatic and over reaching as it was, worked as a musical because the musical numbers were the products of the imagination of the protagonist, an immigrant obsessed with hollywood musicals. likewise, the very cynical and enjoyable \"chicago\" worked on a similar level because the musical numbers were the products of a homicidal ingenue singer/dancer. musicals don\\'t work when they take their own musical-nature too seriously (like in \"moulin rouge\") or are simply too much fluff about nothing (i.e. something pointless like \"mary poppins\"). upon viewing \"oliver!\" for the first time as an adult, i saw it in a new light. told mostly from the point of view young oliver, i saw the musical numbers as the products of his childhood imagination and his way of coping with the horrors of ghetto life around him. the best musical number was probably when nancy got everyone in the tavern signing and dancing about the joys of getting drunk (as a cover to help poor oliver escape the clutches of the evil bill sykes). it was undeniably catchy and sounded like a real pub tune that drunks might start singing around a piano. there are other great and classic tunes to be heard here, and the direction and acting from the leads to the dancing extras are all top notch.<br /><br />still, for all its bleakness (although it does have a happy ending for oliver at least, though certainly things didn\\'t end happily for nancy, and unless you think a life on the streets being a pick-pocket is fun, it wasn\\'t a necessarily a good ending for fagin or the dodger, despite their peppy closing tune) i wouldn\\'t really classify this as a family film, though i don\\'t think showing it to kids over the age of seven or eight will do any harm. this is a harsh tale about an unfortunate orphan trying to survive on the streets and find some happiness. i think it would be very interesting to see a modern update on this some how, perhaps a revisionist take on it, where people on the streets of compton break into happy songs about their horrible lives. i\\'d like to see a hard-edged hip-hop version of \"oliver!\". i always thought dickens would translate well in those regards. as it stands, \"oliver!\" was probably the last of the great film musicals and maybe the strangest g-rated film i\\'ve ever seen.\\n',\n",

       " \"this film is pure elvira and shows her at her breast... i mean best! the story (co-written by cassandra peterson, elvira's alter ego) is inspiring and captivating and is brought to life by elvira's wit and charm. the viewer gets an opportunity to see elvira in a whole new light as she struggles with the prejudices of the people of fallwell, massachusetts (where she has travelled from los angeles in order to attend the reading of her great aunt morganna's will) and at the same time tries to help the long-suffering teenagers who have been deprived of fun by the matriarchal chastity pariah and the rest of the town council. she also has to deal with her attraction to bob redding, the owner of the local cinema, and another woman (patty) who has her eye on bob as well but is not nearly as deserving of his love as elvira. and, later in the movie, she also faces the complications of being descended from ''a major metaphysical celebrity'' and the charges of witchcraft brought against her which mean that she will be burnt at the stake. elvira manages to be both sexy and vulnerable, streetwise and naive in this film, while cracking risque jokes and delivering off-beat lines with double meanings.<br /><br />this movie is inspiring because it gives out the message of never giving up on yourself and always trying to follow your dreams. in the end elvira's dreams finally come true, which is the best thing that could happen to this wonderfully unique and determined woman.<br /><br />i've seen this movie countless times and i never ever get tired of it! there are no unnecessary scenes and i found myself captivated throughout the whole movie. a review will not do justice to the actual movie, so i can just tell you to please watch it because it is one of the best movies ever made! meanwhile, i wish you ''unpleasant dreams!''\\n\",\n",

       " \"french director jean rollin isn't exactly known for great films, and this confusing mess is one of the reasons why. one of the most confusing things about this production is the title. for a director who is well known for directing erotic films about lesbian vampires; you would expect a film with the word 'nude' in the title to be a particularly bare-breasted one; but in fact, there's not a lot of nudity here at all. instead of erotic lesbian vampires with no clothes on; we've got a cumbersome plot about a man who wants to unlock the secret to immortality, a young woman whose affliction might hold the key and a suicide cult, who don't get to do much. the film starts off promisingly with a sequence that sees a young girl carried off by a mysterious bunch of people in masks under the watchful eye of a young french man, who also happens to be the son of a man of importance. through his investigation, he soon discovers that this woman is not just a normal lady, and as he delves deeper into the cult; he discovers that cannot be killed by bullets, drinks blood and can't go out in daylight...sounds like a clear cut case of vampirism to me.<br /><br />jean rollin keeps the fantasy atmosphere going throughout the film, but it fails to be interesting because the plot is so badly executed. it is possible to keep up with what's going on, but only because there's so many other films that follow similar plots to this one. the director seems to know that he's messed up the plotting too, as the climax is basically an excuse to explain the film to the audience. there is a twist thrown in at the end also; but the film would have been better without it. i guess this was jean rollin's attempt to be a little original, but it comes off as a ham-fisted attempt at such, rather than a logical continuation of the story. the cinematography is fairly neat, with lots of the plot taking place in suitably gothic locations. the girls on board complete what is a pretty picture, and what rollin's film lacks in logic and consistency, it somewhat makes up for in style. in the film's defence, it was made in 1969; which somewhat explains the lack of shocks but i can't recommend this movie as it doesn't have much about it that is worth taking note of.\\n\",\n",
       " \"attack force has a horrendous title, and can almost certainly be judged by it's awful cover, because the film is horrible! a mish-mash of plot lines, a choppy mess, and a horribly stagnated pace, make the film hard to watch start to finish. i managed this and i'm proud. as a fan of seagal's work (mostly of his old days), it's painful to see him star in such tripe. true seagal's last half dozen movies or so, have sucked a lot, but some of them at least had some redeeming features. attack force is a mess. from conception to delivery this film has undergone many changes, from an alien plot line, to the current one about a highly addictive super drug, about to be unleashed on the romanian (the film has several settings, none of which are romanian, but all look like romania because they are in romania!) populace. the film is tacked together with little regard for whatever state the original shooting script was. plot-holes and loose ends are abound in the film that's for sure. that's been a problem in seagal's last few films as well, but never has the result been so boring. there's a whole plot line about the water supply being poisoned with ctx (that's the drugs cool name) that is never resolved! <br /><br />of course in recent years the plot's haven't been the main draw in the seagal canon so there was a big onus on the other departments, especially the action. before i regard the action though, all the other departments are poor. the direction is poor, or perhaps better put, made to look poor. who knows how director michael keusch originally intended this film? between him finishing his job, the re-shoots by stunt man tom delmar, and the editing, a coherent auteur vision is completely lost. the best way to describe the film is that it's just all over the shop! the cinematography is dull, nearly inducing sleep, while the droning score (sounding like it was produced on the cheapest of cheap synthesizers) does nothing to excite matters. the cast too are poor, unable to salvage anything here. seagal looks bored beyond recognition, and is dubbed through much of the picture, clearly when plot-points are being changed. he looks tired and overweight, and lethargic, unlike he's looked in previous pictures too (remarkable as the aforementioned have been key complaints in seagal's recent pictures). the only redeemable cast member is adam croasdell as one of the villains, doing a slimy brit routine. he seems to be a throwback to the alien plot line, because he's playing it inhuman. he seems like a cross between a body snatcher and a vampire (ditto to the lead villain played by some hot chick who appears on occasion, seemingly waiting for her husband\\x85 dracula).<br /><br />finally the action. well it's poor. poorly conceived, poorly shot. there's not much either, and there's even less featuring seagal. stevo doesn't really bring out the stunt double here, because there's so little to do. there's even a lengthy (repetitive and boring) action scene on the hour mark that inter-cuts occasionally with little flashes of seagal's stand in because clearly seagal wasn't there while the scene was being shot, and they wanted to have him feature in the action scene. seagal eventually appears in person to shoot two guys in the head. seagal has a producers credit here and a script credit, but from what i understand the film has been altered behind his back to the current state it's in. seagal will apparently not be working with these people again, or with castel studio's who continue to deliver horrifically sub-nu-image (that's saying something), material.<br /><br />overall this is one to avoid if you are not a seagal fan. seagal fans can also be safe in the knowledge that the big man probably won't want to do anything this bad again. unfortunately his next film which has already been shot, with the same people, promises to be even worse than this. *\\n\",\n",
       " \"i found 'time at the top' an entertaining and stimulating experience. the acting, while not generally brilliant, was perfectly acceptable and sometimes very good. as a film obviously aimed at the younger demographic, it is certainly one of the better works in the genre (children's sci-fi). normally, i would say that canada, the united kingdom and australia produce the best movies and tv shows for children, and 'time at the top' does nothing to discount this theory! i don't think that continuity and great acting are important to younger people. a good plot and an imaginative screenplay are far more important to them. both are in abundance in this film. the special effects are good, without detracting from the story, or closing the viewers off from their own imaginations. it would have been very easy to inject an over-load of sfx in this film, but it would have totally destroyed its entire 'raison d'etre'. <br /><br />the settings and camera work are of a very high standard in this movie, and complement the fine wardrobe and historical accuracy. overall, this film is highly satisfactory, and i recommend it to all viewers who can see the world through children's eyes, or those that try to, like myself! now, i really must read the original book, as soon as possible.\\n\",\n",

       " 'having previously seen the abridged print presented by david shepard, i finally got a hold of a complete--or nearer complete version, which was about 56 minutes compared to the 30-minute version more widely distributed. the shepard print for image entertainment is certainly of superior quality, and the best parts are there, but it\\'s nonetheless good to see the rest of the film and fill in some loose story ends.<br /><br />in the shepard print, the film ends with mary stating, \"you see, i\\'ve changed my mind--i\\'m never going home.\" yet, in the complete version, mary and kenneth driscoll end their relationship soon after that scene \\x96 mary returns home to the country \\x96 and driscoll rekindles his relationship with vivian. this additional footage develops the character vivian, who had little relevance in the shepard version. moreover, in the complete version, the film begins in the new jersey countryside with mary, where she reads and fantasizes about her ideal lover. she\\'s disappointed by the reality of the advances by farm \"chore boy\" johnny applebloom (a character completely absent from the shepard version), but after her affair with driscoll, she returns to the country to presumably and eventually become a farmer\\'s wife.<br /><br />regardless of the print, \\'a girl\\'s folly\\' is a good little film for 1917, made by one of the top directors of the 1910s maurice tourneur. in it, tourneur takes plenty of jabs at his own business, including by playing a caricature of himself--the director of the film-within-the-film. the two leads also give quality performances by early screen-acting standards: robert warwick, an actor playing a skirt-chasing star, and doris kenyon, as an ingénue aspiring to play an ingénue on the screen.<br /><br />self-referential films, which made film-making the focus of the films, were nothing new by now. mack sennett had already parodied this type of film three years prior with \\'mabel\\'s dramatic career\\'. several aspects of this one stand out, though. frances marion\\'s intertitles are humorous, including illustrations of the actors on a chessboard with a hand directing them--remarkable for 1917. i especially liked the film\\'s final title cards where two observers remark on the film\\'s happy ending: \"gee but ain\\'t that romantick!\" and, the other replies, \"romance, nuthin! \\x96 that\\'s movin\\' pictures!\" fellow female screenwriter anita loos made a similar self-referential conclusion to another film from 1917 \\'wild and woolly\\'. both writers helped change the role of their professions in the business and art.<br /><br />some of the photography by tourneur and john van den broek is good, especially concerning the film-making business. the use of mirrors in several scenes is a nice reinforcement of the film\\'s self-reflexivity. furthermore, the editing is exceptional. the quick crosscutting during the studio scenes is especially salient; it serves to punctuate the hectic pace filmmakers work at, especially back then.\\n',\n",

(not even you, gary, can dispute that claim) james gandolfini, who plays the lead-man, tony soprano, has become (in this viewer\\'s opinion) one of the \"hollywood elites\" as far as acting in a television series goes. i wouldn\\'t go ahead and compare him with robert deniro or al pacino, or at least, not just yet. he, however, does do a hell of a job playing the part of tony soprano. in the years since 1999, gandolfini has risen so much so as an actor (mainly thanks to his role in the sopranos) that today he is considered to be among the best in the business. and it\\'s not just him. \"the sopranos\" fields a great supporting cast including that of lorraine bracco, edie falco, michael imperioli, dominic chianese, and the late nancy marchand who played tony\\'s dreadful mother. at this point in the show\\'s existence, it\\'s being considered a cult-classic and rightfully so. the first two seasons were extraordinary. violent and quite gruesome in a pretty frequent manner, but without a doubt, extraordinarily done. the third season was great, but didn\\'t quite live up to the hype of seasons 1 and 2. season 4, which wrapped up right before new-years, was the weakest season yet (or at least, in my opinion it was). despite a dry-spell, i still found it (season 4 of \"the sopranos\") to be more entertaining than most of its competition and that\\'s saying a lot because lately i\\'ve been noticing a trend in good new television shows. examples of this: six feet under, the shield, curb your enthusiasm, and oz (which is not technically a new show but ended with an unforgettable final season this year). to get back to my point though, to consider a show better than all the competition during a particularly bad year, no less, is quite an accomplishment on the part of the writers. \"the sopranos\" ranks above and beyond all other television shows in its era and its writers deserve a lot of credit. to close, i\\'d like to say, \"the sopranos\" is the real deal folks. for the average mature viewer (17 and above) who enjoys drama and doesn\\'t mind a mixing of a little violence and profanity, you might want to check out \"the sopranos\" if you get the chance. trust me in that it will be well worth the time.\\n',\n",

       " 'going down as the most expensive film in finnish history, to date, \"dark floors\" is a horror film with an extremely lynchian narrative that recounts an ever increasingly decrepit series of \"floors\" (ironically enough) in an abandoned hospital, in which our protagonists are trapped. lead by an autistic daughter and her father, himself disenchanted with the hospitals apparent lack of medical progress with his daughter, make their way into an elevator debating the issue with one of the hospitals nurses. accompanied by a security guard, a businessman and a seemingly intoxicated tramp the collective soon find the complex abandoned, but they are not alone. directed by finnish- born pete riski, more known for his television work, \"dark floors\" is filmed in english, using mainly english actors but has the notable inclusion of finland\\'s arguably most famous group \"lordi\" (2006 eurovision song contest winners) as themselves, i.e. in their on stage monstrous costumes, as the films antagonists, yet for all this razzmatazz the production fails where it is needed most, in convincing the audience.<br /><br />any film that has their lead character use the phrase \"it\\'s too quiet\" is already headed down a dubious path, and this lordi influenced horror does not break that convention. for all the good ideas that are thrown into the mix there are a handful of ripe clichés alongside and worst of all, anything that is interestingly original isn\\'t fleshed out enough for it to resonate. the concept of the degrading floors is initially highly ominous and does provide a sense of inevitable doom as the audience is aware those trapped in the hospital must progress ever further down in the mire. however, there isn\\'t enough atmosphere created to scare and intimidate the audiences into the unknowing fear, the viewer is aware the journey will become ever more dangerous, as the levels degenerate from shiny white through to hellish black, but i don\\'t think the characters are aware enough of this fact for it to be threatening. also, the entire film taking place in what is essentially its own time bubble is again a very nice touch, a concept not often used in the horror genre, but the characters don\\'t confront the situation with enough fear and trepidation when they stumble across this fact, they continue about their business far too readily and without enough genuine concern for the idea to mean anything to the audience. these initially good ideas are just left to go to waste, as if the director and/or mr lordi (who had many of the ideas used within the film) had these thoughts, but couldn\\'t agree or decide on how to best use them and as such lose their purpose and point. <br /><br />yet for all the frustration there are large quantities of comedy, yet not for the reasons the creators would have hoped for. too much is clichéd, too much is recycled and too much is just simply ridiculous. while the lead is amicably acted by noah huntley, the characters are mere cardboard cut outs that have been pasted into the story from other films. we have a lead man doing everything possible to protect his daughter alongside a clunkily developed love interest. accompanying the \"couple\" we have the traditional token black man as a hard-nosed security guard, with the nigh on infinite clip for his sidearm, and a weasely disbelieving businessman only on the look out for himself. worst of all though, unfortunately, is the introduction of the cast of lordi as the creatures of the night that torment our wandering band of misfits, but not for them appearing as themselves. what makes a horror film scary to the viewing audience is contextualising the fear. \"the shining\" is scary because it\\'s a member of your own family hounding you, in \"dawn of the dead\" it\\'s our fear of each other and the primordial cannibalism and irrational thought patterns the zombies possess, in \"alien\" the fear is explained, the creature is rationalised and in \"dark floors\" there is none of that. perhaps it\\'s unfair to compare this production to these monoliths of the genre but when you do it shows it pales significantly and that it\\'s aggressors feel like nothing more than demented klingons where you can almost see the zip on the costumes they wear, without a build up of any atmosphere \"lordi\" just aren\\'t scary.<br /><br />it\\'s infuriating because we all cheer for the underdog and hope they do well, you want the smaller productions to say that they can create the same quality of film as \"hollywood\" churns out, much in the similar way that george a romero started out, but it doesn\\'t always materialise. i enjoyed the film and didn\\'t feel as if i had wasted the ninety minutes i had just sat through, but i felt enjoyment on a completely hollow level as if nothing that had occurred mattered or affected me subconsciously, emotionally or critically. i felt the almost lynchian narrative was a standout plus point, but it fades out into nothingness. why did it happen? what does it mean? will they go through this all again? without even the slightest insight into what will happen the film is simply puzzling for the sake of trying to be arty. was the entire sequence of events real or was it merely a dream sequence? had the autistic girl watched the eurovision song contest of 2006 and simply had a highly bizarre nightmare given the stress she was under? who knows? and unfortunately i fail to work up the energy to even care. \"dark floors\" is an infuriating experience that while ultimately shallow hallmarks potential and at the very least shows a plethora of creative energies from mr lordi, who perhaps should look into working solo to fully develop his ideas. it\\'s one that fans of the group or the genre should perhaps pursue but will leave you feeling left in the lurch for not having enough light shed on the situation.\\n',\n",
       " 'hubert selby jr. gave us the book \"requiem for a dream\" and co-wrote the screenplay to aronofsky\\'s movie of it. that movie succeeded on every level by delivering an intimate, and unbiased portrait of the horrors of the characters lives and the vices that destroyed them. \"last exit to brooklyn\" still has the vice and the multiple characters living sad lives, but it hardly does them the same justice aronofsky did.<br /><br />the film seems laughably anti-gay at times. especially when in the film homosexuality equals death. one gay character gets stoned, is launched skyward by a speeding car, and lands dead on the pavement. another is crucified and still more are simply beat up. another exaggerated piece of shock value, that might actually have been compelling if it were done well, are scenes of the union workers literally doing battle with the strike-breakers. who\\'d have thought a drama about brooklyners would feature action sequences and truck explosions?<br /><br />the director, uli edel has a skill level like that of a tv director, but he is far below the cut for real movies. the film is clunky that can\\'t even seem to settle on a genre. lake is given a useless role that any mannequin could have filled and baldwin only seems to know how to look stupid in his equally meager part. and then comes jennifer jason leigh as our lead, a loathsome hooker named tralala (believe it or not, i\\'m not joking). her performance is nothing great and the fate of her character is dirty to say the least. poor use of color and composition make it look cheaper than it is, and also takes the \"real\" edge off the more provocative bits. a failure.\\n',\n",
       " '\"the 700 club\" has to be the single most bigoted television program in the history of television itself. to make matters worse, it\\'s been on the air since 1966, implying that thousands if not millions of people are buying into its hate and lies. headed by pat robertson, the unscrupulous, megalomaniacal founder and leader of the christian coalition, \"the 700 club\" takes us from misinformation to misunderstanding, broadcasting \"news\" as they like to think of it and trying to convince its audience that all of the world\\'s problems are to blame on homosexuals, wiccans, new age spiritualists, muslims, jews, hindus, non-fundamentalist christians, democrats, single mothers, foreigners, feminists, evolutionists, environmentalists, nasa scientists, and anyone else who doesn\\'t share their fanatical religious views. it\\'s actually the best fake news since \"the daily show\" or the \"weekend update\" segment of \"saturday night live,\" or since \"fox news,\" for that matter. of course, pat\\'s always the one who makes each of the decisions, saying whatever comes to mind and not giving a damn who it offends or hurts. in the meantime, he continues his part in the struggle to transform the united states into a militarized police state by having the religious wrong stick their noses in everything they can and asking for one donation after another - no less than a measly $100 to become a member, by the way - to fund pat\\'s african diamond mines and buy oil from companies reprimanded by the government in the past for their abuse of the environment. no, never mind that pat was good friends with the genocidal dictators of zaire and zimbabwe in order to help him acquire such wealth; it\\'s all for the greater glory of god, don\\'t you know? and of course, the hosts of \"the 700 club\" are always willing to read letters \"written by viewers\" as they like to put it, coincidentally each typed in the same format and all on the same color of paper by \"viewers\" supposedly healed of various afflictions by the said hosts (they claim to have \"words of knowledge\" come to them) but who never appear on the program to say what happened to them. honestly, how can anyone take a show seriously when they\\'re using a poor applause recording? it should make people wonder why there\\'s no studio audience.<br /><br />the sad thing that pat\\'s cronies and viewers don\\'t realize or just don\\'t want to realize are the horrible things he\\'s done and said. this is a guy who agreed with jerry falwell that the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states were the result of god punishing us for our acceptance of homosexuality and feminism. ironic, considering that pat has twice publicly referred to the implementation of a nuclear weapon in the state department; i have little doubt it was his wealth that kept him from getting arrested for such statements. his rants against homosexuals, single mothers, and any number of sexual practices he considers \"sinful\" are interesting, considering he was known to frequent a number of brothels during the korean war. as the bible says, be fruitful and multiply, so congratulations, pat - thanks to you, there\\'s probably a number of children born to single korean mothers. then, of course, there was the time he called for the assassination of venezuelan president hugo chavez (not that he\\'s a saint, but still). oh, yes, and let\\'s not soon forget the time this \"crusader for human life\" supported forced abortions in china. very \"christian\" of him, wouldn\\'t you say?<br /><br />and just in case pat has forgotten, i haven\\'t forgotten his little speech that evangelical christians today are \"being treated exactly as the jews were in nazi germany.\" honestly, to compare his \"plight\" to the horrors of the holocaust is almost unforgivable. speaking of which, need i mention about how he blatantly lied that homosexuality ran rampant among the nazi party in a pathetic attempt to discredit homosexuals? of course, history shows us that the nazis acted toward homosexuals the same way they acted toward jews. pat robertson is one of the biggest liars in history. if he was pinocchio, his nose would encircle the earth.<br /><br />unfortunately, more and more people continue to believe him every day. this is your wake-up call, people; \"the 700 club\" is one of the most if not the single most vile program in television history. it\\'s evil masquerading as good; it\\'s a wolf-in-sheep\\'s-clothing. it\\'s bigoted filth that tries to look clean, pretty, and loving. it\\'s living proof that hateful, dangerous religious views aren\\'t confined to certain groups in the middle east. even those who are not of the christian faith know that it goes against everything jesus taught, and if jesus was to appear to this \"club,\" he wouldn\\'t be emulating them. instead, he\\'d be chastising them as he did the pharisees of his time and overturning the money bins of their telethons as he did in front of the synagogue in his time. all i can say is thank god that pat had no chance of becoming president; if he did, he\\'d be the harbinger of armageddon - and not on the side of the good guys.\\n',\n",

       " 'first off, i must say that i made the mistake of watching the election films out of sequence. i say unfortunately, because after seeing election 2 first, election seems a bit of a disappointment. both films are gangster epics that are similar in form. and while election is an enjoyable piece of cinema... it\\'s just not nearly as good as it\\'s sequel.<br /><br />in the first election installment, we are shown the two competitors for chairman; big d and lok. after a few scenes of discussion amongst the \"uncle\\'s\" as to who should have the chairman title, they (almost unanimously) decide that lok (simon yam) will helm the triads. suffice to say this doesn\\'t go over very well with competitor big d (tony leung ka fai) and in a bid to influence the takeover, big d kidnaps two of the uncles in order to sway the election board to his side. this has disastrous results and heads the triads into an all out war. lok is determined to become chairman but won\\'t become official until he can recover the \"dragon head baton\", a material representation of the chairman\\'s power. the current chairman, whistle (chung wang) has hidden the baton somewhere in mainland china and the race is on to see who can recover it first.<br /><br />much of the film is devoted to the recovery of the baton. as both aspiring leaders search for it they must dodge cops and opposite sides, which leads into one of the stand out scenes in election, which involves an underling named jet (nick cheung), a machete, and lots of bad guys. nick cheung\\'s presence is attention grabbing to say the least... i wonder if this influenced director johhnie to in any way while making the second election, as he does deliver more of jet\\'s character in the sequel.<br /><br />while nick cheung gives a scene stealing performance, i must not fail to give due to the rest of the film\\'s actors. election has a great ensemble cast with well thought out performances that are both subtle and impacting. simon yam is his usually glorious self and the film also benefits from heavyweight hk actors like louis koo, tony leung ka fai, and the under-appreciated suet lam. there really aren\\'t any weak links in the acting and one could easily believe that they\\'re watching real gangsters.<br /><br />although the performances are great, one of the most impressive things about election is johnnie to\\'s eye for the camera. there are some truly striking shots in the film and it goes without saying that to definitely knows how to frame his shots, as the viewer is treated to a series of innovative and quite brilliant camera placings and angles. all of which makes election, above all, a great looking film.<br /><br />my issues with the film arises mostly out of the shear amount of characters involved in election. it gets a bit hard to follow because the film is so full of characters that aren\\'t integral to the plot. while the sequel opts to focus more on the two candidates, the first election offers the election process as a whole with tons of uncles, underlings, and police officers crowding the storyline. maybe the film would have worked better if it would have been a bit longer with more time dedicated to the inner workings of the triad, or if director johnnie to would have funneled down the necessary elements and expounded on them more. <br /><br />bottom line- all in all, this is a wonderfully brutal film with a great cast, excellent direction, and leisurely pacing that packs a punch. it\\'s just a little more complicated than it needed to be.\\n',\n",

       " 'mario lanza, of course, is \"the great caruso\" in this 1951 film also starring ann blyth, dorothy kirsten, eduard franz and ludwig donath. this is a highly fictionalized biography of the legendary, world-renowned tenor whose name is known even today.<br /><br />the film is opulently produced, and the music is glorious and beautifully sung by lanza, kirsten, judmila novotna, blanche thebom, and other opera stars who appeared in the film. if you\\'re a purist, seeing people on stage smiling during the sextet from \"lucia\" will strike you as odd - even if caruso\\'s wife dorothy just had a baby girl. also it\\'s highly unlikely that caruso ever sang edgardo in lucia; the role lay too high for him.<br /><br />in taking dramatic license, the script leaves out some very dramatic parts of caruso\\'s life. what was so remarkable about him is that he actually created roles in operas that are today in the standard repertoire, yet this is never mentioned in the film. these roles include maurizio in adriana lecouvreur and dick johnson in \"girl of the golden west,\" there is a famous photo of him posing with a sheet wrapped around him like a toga. the reason for that photo? his only shirt was in the laundry. he was one of the pioneers of recorded music and had a long partnership with the victor talking-machine company (later rca victor). he was singing jose in carmen in san francisco the night of the earthquake.<br /><br />instead, the mgm story basically has him dying on stage during a performance of martha, which never happened. he had a hemorrhage during \"l\\'elisir d\\'amore\" at the met and could not finish the performance; he only sang three more times at the met, his last role as eleazar in la juive. what killed him? the same thing that killed valentino - peritonitis. his first role at the met was not radames in aida, as indicated in the film, but the duke in rigoletto. so when it says on the screen \"suggested by dorothy caruso\\'s biography of her husband,\" that\\'s what it was - suggested. what is true is that dorothy\\'s father disowned her after her marriage, and left her $1 of his massive estate. they also did have a daughter gloria together (who died at the age of 79 on 10/7/2007). however, caruso had four other children by a mistress before he married dorothy.<br /><br />some people say that lanza\\'s voice is remarkably like caruso\\'s, but just listen to caruso sing in the film \"match point\" -- caruso\\'s voice is remarkably unlike lanza\\'s. in fact, from his sound, had he wanted to, caruso could have sung as a baritone. he is thought to have had some trouble with high notes, further evidence of baritone leanings; and the role he was preparing when he died was othello, a dramatic tenor role, which lanza definitely was not. lanza\\'s voice deserved not to be compared with another. he made a unique contribution to film history, popularizing operatic music. he sings the music in \"the great caruso\" with a robust energy; he is truly here at the peak of what would be a short career. his acting is natural and genuine. ann blyth is lovely as dorothy and gets to sing a little herself.<br /><br />really a film for opera lovers and lanza fans, which are probably one and the same.\\n',\n",

       " \"i had never heard of this one before it turned up on cable tv. it's very typical of late 50s sci-fi: sober, depressing and not a little paranoid! despite the equally typical inclusion of a romantic couple, the film is pretty much put across in a documentary style - which is perhaps a cheap way of leaving a lot of the exposition to narration and an excuse to insert as much stock footage as is humanly possibly for what is unmistakably an extremely low-budget venture! while not uninteresting in itself (the-apocalypse-via-renegade-missile angle later utilized, with far greater aplomb, for both dr. strangelove [1964] and fail-safe [1964]) and mercifully short, the film's single-minded approach to its subject matter results in a good deal of unintentional laughter - particularly in the scenes involving an imminent childbirth and a gang of clueless juvenile delinquents!\\n\",\n",
       " 'the main problem i see with this film is its score, which screams with every note, \"this is a cheap-ass movie.\" there\\'s not much more to say here. the score just plain sucked.<br /><br />the second problem, which i see as quite severe as well as it involves the unwinding of the plot near the end of the film (one of the the money shots, if you will), is the dialogue between martha (adrienne barbeau) and the sunflower man (richard ziman), in which martha is revealed to be the leader of the experiment. at all times during this dialogue, the viewer is very much aware that s/he is listening to a movie dialogue. in other words, suspension of disbelief breaks down here. the integrity of a believable dialogue between two people is sacrificed for a willy-nilly stuffing of information the movie makers wish to impart to the audience.<br /><br />the third problem was the casting of adrienne barbeau. while i honestly believe her to be a fabulous actress within her oeuvre, i feel that this part may have been too much of a stretch. the main point of her performance that didn\\'t seem to mesh was the spectrum across which the character moves through the film from a loving mother of a troubled family to an almost rambo-like woman on a mission. this aspect of the script would obviously have been a stretch for any actress, and one cannot place too much blame, therefore, upon barbeau. to the degree that she fairly competently acted her part, however, i would only call this a moderately severe problem to the film as a whole.<br /><br />finally, the film did a wonderful job in the first half building a creep factor, most notably during its horror flashes. i feel that the film would have benefited by more of a commitment to these flashes as a mechanism for preventing a fizzling of the creep factor in the second half of the movie.<br /><br />so what\\'s my holistic grading of this piece? i\\'d give it a solid c+ to b-, depending upon how much credit you\\'re inclined to give the makers for producing this film on a limited budget. even with two severe and two moderately severe problems, the film is premised on the solid plot of the jungian side of nazi mysticism. i see no problems with plot development or coherence; the dialogue, with the noted exception above, is downright brilliant in places, especially the all important keystone scene between mother and daughter at the beginning of the movie; as mentioned, the creep factor was well crafted, if a bit fizzly in the second half; and nicholas brendan, who also associated produced, delivered a wonderful performance.<br /><br />all in all, this film is definitely worth the view---see it with a nazi you love. :)\\n',\n",

       " \"although there are some snippets in this 4-part documentary hinting at the necessity for recreational drug law reform, these are not very well-developed, in contrast to the many snippets from those who feel that the drugs that happen to currently be illegal are a scourge for which the only imaginable solution is incarceration of even those who are guilty even of mere possession of such drugs.<br /><br />although this program, as a whole, leaves the viewer with the impression that the drug war is largely a futile exercise and a waste of money, and for that it deserves some praise, almost nothing in this documentary addresses the very real problems that total war against those who merely possess illegal drugs obviously causes and contributes to--very real problems that most drug warriors themselves would tell you, if asked, they think the drug war is designed to solve. for example, while many minutes are spent on the surge in violence associated with the rising popularity of crack cocaine in the 80's, at no point does this program even hint that the very laws designed to suppress crack cocaine make it impossible for drug sellers to enforce their contracts and business arrangements in courts of law, forcing them to resort to violence to stay in business. but instead of seeing the laws as an important cause of the violence, the drugs themselves seem to take the brunt of the blame. inexplicably, alcohol prohibition, the violence that ensued, and the subsequent reversal of prohibition, is totally ignored by this program.<br /><br />this program will help to perpetuate ridiculous stereotypes of drug users, and it is these that are the primary force in driving the very expensive and very problematic drug war. the possibility of incorporating drugs other than alcohol into a happy and successful life is not really touched on. use of any drug in excess is probably going to cause personal problems, but not all users do their drugs in excess, just like not all alcohol users are alcoholics.<br /><br />if you want a point of view from someone who believes that adults have a moral right not to be incarcerated and have their lives ruined by the criminal justice system just for using drugs that the government, for mostly very arbitrary political reasons rather than reasons based on sound social policy and legitimate science, has decided to totally prohibit, whose users it has decided to not-so-metaphorically wage war against, just forget about it. none of that is in here.<br /><br />on the other hand, this is hardly in the category of anti-drug propaganda. it is mostly an interesting neutrally-presented history of drugs in 20th century united states like marijuana, lsd, heroin, cocaine, mdma, and oxycontin. but there is a significant element of various people's points of view with regard to drug laws, and most (but not all) of that is not very thoughtful or well-informed and slanted in favor of the drug warrior mentality, especially with respect to drugs other than marijuana. <br /><br />the criminal justice system, along with its often harsh life-ruining penalties, is obviously not the only answer or the most appropriate answer to every single social problem, but unfortunately there's an epidemic in this nation of an as-yet unnamed disease whose primary symptoms are a lack of imagination with respect to social policy when it comes to certain drugs, a lack of compassion for fellow humans, a prejudice against people who use the drugs that are not governmentally-approved, perhaps a vested interest in the growth of the prison/policing industry, and a horrid apathy with regard to human dignity. it's morally wrong to kidnap or incarcerate people unless you have a very damn good reason for doing so, and the mere possession of an arbitrarily selected group of drugs is clearly not such a reason. this is really the primary issue when it comes to drugs, yet this program ignores it.<br /><br />so, in sum, the parts of this program that neutrally present history without feeding stereotypes of drug users that are at the heart of the drug war mentality are pretty good and interesting and entertaining. but when it comes to presenting a rational non-radical point of view with regard to drug policy, and giving the viewer examples not only of people with drug problems but also the many people who successfully incorporate drugs into happy and successful lives, it's pretty disappointing.\\n\",\n",

       " '*** contains spoilers ***<br /><br />i did not like this movie at all.<br /><br />i found it amazingly boring and rather superficially made, irrespective of the importance and depth of the proposed themes: given that eventually we have to die, how should we approach life? in a \"light\" way, like tomas; in a \"heavy\" way like tereza; or should we find ways not to face that question, like sabina? how much is fidelity important in a relationship? how much of the professional life can be mutilated for the sake of our loved ones? how much do we have to be involved in the political life and the social issues of our country?<br /><br />unfortunately, i haven\\'t read kundera\\'s novel but after having being let down by the movie i certainly will: i want to understand if the story was ruined by the movie adaptation (which is my guess) or if it was dull from the beginning.<br /><br />i disagree with most of the positive comments that defined the movie as a masterpiece. i simply don\\'t see the reasons why. what i see are many flaws, and a sample of them follows.<br /><br />1) the three main characters are thrown at you and it\\'s very hard to understand what drives them when making their choices.<br /><br />2) the \"secondary\" characters are there just to fill the gaps but they don\\'t add nothing to the story and you wonder if they are really necessary.<br /><br />3) i did not like how tomas was impersonated. nothing is good for him. he is so self-centered and selfish. he is not human, in some sense. but when his self-confidence fails and he realizes that he depends on others and is emotionally linked to someone, i did not find the interpretation credible.<br /><br />4) it\\'s very unlikely that an artist like sabina could afford her lifestyle in a communist country in 1968. on top of that, the three main characters are all very successful in their respective professions, which sounds strange to me. a) how can tereza become effortlessly such a good photographer? b) how can they do so well in a country lacking all the economic incentives that usually motivate people to succeed?<br /><br />5) the fake accents of the english spoken by the actors are laughable. and i am not even mother tongue. moreover, the letter that sabina receives while in the us is written in czech, which i found very inconsistent.<br /><br />6) many comments praised the movie saying that prague was beautifully rendered: i guess that most of the movie was shot on location, so it\\'s not difficult to give the movie a eastern european feeling, and given the intrinsic beauty of prague is not even difficult to make it look good.<br /><br />7) i found the ending sort of trivial. tereza and tomas, finally happy in the countryside, far away from the temptations of the \"metropoly\", distant from the social struggles their fellow citizens are living, detached from their professional lives, die in a car accident. but they die after having realized that they are happy, indeed. so what? had they died unhappy, would the message of the movie have been different? i don\\'t think so. i considered it sort of a cheap trick to please the audience.<br /><br />8) the only thing in the movie which is unbearably light is the way the director has portrayed the characters. you see them for almost three hours, but in the end you are left with nothing. you don\\'t feel empathy, you don\\'t relate to them, you are left there in your couch watching a sequence of events and scenes that have very little to say.<br /><br />9) i hated the \"stop the music in the restaurant\" scene (which some comments praised a lot). why sabina has got such a strong reaction? why franz agrees with her? i really don\\'t see the point. the only thing you learn is that sabina has got a very bad temper and quite a strong personality. that\\'s it. what\\'s so special and unique about it?<br /><br />after all these negative comments, let me point tout that there are two scenes that i liked a lot (that\\'s why i gave it a two).<br /><br />the \"naked women photoshoot\", where the envy, the jealousy, and the insecurities of sabina and tereza are beautifully presented.<br /><br />the other scene is the one representing the investigations after the occupation of prague by the russians. tereza pictures, taken to let the world know about what is going on in prague, are used to identify the people taking part to the riots. i found it quite original and tereza\\'s sense of despair and guilt are nicely portrayed.<br /><br />finally, there is a tiny possibility that the movie was intentionally \"designed\" in such a way that \"tomas types\" are going to like it and \"tereza ones\" are going to hate it. if this is the case (i strongly doubt it, though) then my comment should be revised drastically.\\n',\n",

       " 'no, just kidding. it was god-awful.<br /><br />i was watching my local sci-fi station last night, which plays movies, every night, within a monthly theme. this month it\\'s \"space turkeys, or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bombs\". movies so bad, they should never have been made. this was a good selection.<br /><br />everything about this movie is thoroughly horrible with two exceptions, the gore make-up (which showed potential) and the editing (which slightly out did the rest of the movie, in terms of being horrible). the acting is horrible all around, the dialog is horrible, the script, the direction. it\\'s not a good movie.<br /><br />it consists of two forms of special effects, gore and stock footage of space. i\\'ll focus on the gore. watching this movie, i thought to myself, \"what was the motivation behind the making of this movie?\" people like making stuff, sure, but i was hesitant to think anything good could have come of it for anyone involved. i came to the conclusion that this movie was made as a means to increase the make-up effects guy\\'s demo reel. he (rick baker) actually went on to a pretty nice career, he\\'s worked on star wars (1977), king kong (1976), men in black (1996), and even the incredible shrinking woman (1981), plus a number of other notable flicks. other than that, i can\\'t say i\\'ve ever actually seen a real, live melting man - incredible, or otherwise - but i\\'d have to say this seemed to be a fair representation of one.<br /><br />now, when i think of bad editing, i usually think of maybe a scene where someone\\'s talking on the phone and then, in the middle of the scene, the phone jumps down to his shoulder, or something to that effect. this movie really serves to highlighted the fact that bad editing can take many forms. specifically, over-long and utterly useless scenes. just about every scene dragged on longer than it should have, from a little bit of dead air to that crazy-long screaming scene with cleaver girl. and that severed head in the river, the head gets thrown into a river (in slow motion), the movie carries on for a couple minutes, and then we cut back to the floating head and watch it fall down a waterfall. while i\\'m sure they were all very proud of their severed head, what the hell??<br /><br />lastly, i\\'ll mention the running fat lady/slow motion scene right near the beginning. the jerky slow motion tells me that they didn\\'t shoot the scene in slow motion originally but later decided that it \"wasn\\'t working like that\" and then slowed it down. oy vey. in any event, if you should ever see another movie in which a hysterical fat woman runs down a hall and then directly through a closed, glass door - all in slow motion, mind you - remember the incredible melting man, for *this* is where it all started.<br /><br />movies like this are best viewed at home with a bunch of friends. this one\\'s a little slow most of the time but that\\'s just all the more time to come up with your own one-liners. it\\'s not the worst of the worst but it\\'s pretty freaking bad.\\n',\n",

       " 'polish film maker walerian borowczyk\\'s la bête (french, 1975, aka the beast) is among the most controversial and brave films ever made and a very excellent one too. this film tells everything that\\'s generally been hidden and denied about our nature and our sexual nature in particular with the symbolism and silence of its images. the images may look wild, perverse, \"sick\" or exciting, but they are all in relation with the lastly mentioned. sex, desire and death are very strong and primary things and dominate all the flesh that has a human soul inside it. they interest and temptate us so powerfully (and by our nature) that they are considered scary, unacceptable and something too wild to be true.<br /><br /> a sophisticated young woman travels with her mother to a french countryside to meet her soon-to-become husband whom with she has had a letter affair of some kind. all are very exciting and each others\\' parents and relatives wait impatiently to see the new people arriving to their families. the innocence of the young bride shines through and no one knows what can happen and wake up inside the walls of the big and beautiful french mansion, with all its humans and animals, and a mysterious \"la bête\" that turns out to be something that the characters, nor most of the film\\'s audience, could have never imagined to be real and (in front of) them.<br /><br />the film is about the same theme as canadian david cronenberg\\'s debyt feature shivers (1975), which happens inside a huge luxury building in which destructive and gory parasites spread from human to human by sexual contact and make people act furiously and violently in their lust for pleasure and fulfilment of instincts. human has instincts that can be and are stronger than his will and that is why those instincts can be as dangerous and powerful as the instincts of some other animal, a beast, be it a lust for blood, revenge or sex and carnal pleasure. humans are only animals that have intelligence and tools to convey it but because we are also animals, that intelligence is not always used too much as can be seen anywhere around us. the film opens greatly, and very shockingly for most hypocritic attitudes, showing a horny male horse raging in fury as he waits to get inside the mare and continue the race, but the rage and visible lust we see from his eyes and violent movements are the key elements of that beginning and why it is there, not the close-ups of organs as could be so easily claimed. the horse is a beast that battles in an almost unbearable heat, in heat that\\'s much stronger than his will as he doesn\\'t have any control at that point anymore. the power of the instinct makes an animal a beast.<br /><br />after the memorable beginning, the characters get introduced, and the film fantastically has all the necessary age groups inside it from the little innocent children waiting to grow up and develop to their blossom, to the adults and elders that all represent their own part of the lifespan, creating the face of human life on screen. a film doesn\\'t necessarily need more characters this way as all the important ones are already there and represent the whole race, including the urban and countryside inhabitants, and both sexes. the mansion makes the protagonist girl\\'s sexuality wake as she saws the horses coupling and acting like she obviously has never thought of. for the first time she sees something unique and something that excites and feels almost vital for her and her body, like getting water when you\\'re very thirsty. the transformation of the girl is a very important element in the film as she has lived unaware of these things inside her, with his mother and camera and a letter-boyfriend, even though the things have just waited for the moment to burst out. flesh desires flesh and that belongs to being a humanimal, but still those things are not so easily admitted everywhere and films like these trying to depict it get banned for decades? man\\'s stupidity and unwillingness to interpret images must not be an argument for a film being banned or otherwise violated.<br /><br />the film\\'s last 30 minutes are also as important as the beginning, and once again show how powerful cinema is without needless words and talk. as the girl and audience realizes what her body starts to feel and desire, she starts to have dreams about the mysterious beast that turns out to be none other than the undressed form of ourselves, having lived in the woods without other people/beasts near him. the dream sequence is the one that causes and caused most of the controversy alongside the film\\'s overall straight and honest attitude, and the images are so easy to be judged as \"perverse\" and \"pornographic\", without a courage to go deeper into them, character reactions and thoughts behind what we see. the images are exciting in her dream and also eventually inside the dream for the dream\\'s (more) human character, and borowczyk forces us to admit it with the images that are so close to a \"normal\" sexual act between a man and a female, which is a beautiful thing and expression of love, another human need. also the numerous, and cleverly blackly humorous love making scenes inside the mansion, between the young mother and the black servant, get interrupted many times as someone screams for the servant, for example, and there\\'s no doubt that the sensual image of two young human bodies being together and being interrupted with an angry shout at least doesn\\'t become any more pleasant by the interruption. borowczyk has managed to paint his images so beautiful and \"sensitive\" that his message is almost impossible to be misunderstood, but nothing seems to be impossible for our cultures and minds that criticize art. he uses dialogue only when it\\'s necessary, otherwise the images do the job and make the film powerful.<br /><br />death is also there, as flesh dies sooner or later, after years of life and instincts, it dies. the ending is inevitable but the meaning of the dream sequence could have also been as powerful without the kind of dramatic and \"revealing\" ending too. another blackly humorous element comes when we see the shocked city women running out of the place in which they saw a little more than they were looking for! they visited the mansion of truth about flesh, us and them. the film reminds me of french writer georges bataille\\'s story of the eye with its same themes about eroticism, death and how they both are always connected to the nature of our flesh. the book is well written and fantastic as well as this film, and naturally both have been blamed for their \"too explicit\" content and other equally noteworthy shallow comments.<br /><br />borowczyk\\'s film is also very beautiful visually alongside its raw honesty, and the nature and forest have rarely looked so bright and shining as they do in this film. the sun shines through the trees, and to everyplace where humans live, and the beauty of it is always there, but so is the ugliness that originates by the inhabitants of the world. to every innocent white sheep there\\'s a selfish, evil and horrible beast in our world and that is why the intelligence we have been given never fully seems to overcome the power of our bad instincts and the other side of the sheep, present inside every human soul. it is about how many manages to keep the dark side passive and not active. the fulfilment of some of our instincts is not a bad thing, and by using this intelligence and seeing which of the instincts are good and which bad, they can be satisfied without exploitation, violence and the lethal and destructive circle created by it. human is not more than an animal with intelligence, intelligence that is so easy to be forgotten and eaten to the background by things that feel better and more satisfying at each and perhaps sudden moment. borowczyk\\'s film is a masterpiece, unforgettable and clever piece of magical cinema with ageless theme and also an example of how much can be achieved, expressed and given by a film maker, who is also only a human.\\n',\n",

       " 'this intensely involving 2007 character-driven suspense drama is like a big, juicy piece of shakespearean-level steak from a master filmmaker who knows how to draw out uncommonly ferocious, to-the-edge performances from his actors. consider for starters - henry fonda\\'s lone dissenting juror in \"twelve angry men\", katharine hepburn\\'s delusional mary tyrone in \"long day\\'s journey into night\", rod steiger\\'s conflicted concentration camp survivor in \"the pawnbroker\", william holden\\'s wintry lion in \"network\", and paul newman\\'s alcoholic lawyer in \"the verdict\". the list encompasses some of the finest screen work of the past half-century, and you can safely add philip seymour hoffman\\'s desperately controlling andy hanson to the ranks. at 83, director sidney lumet shows no signs of octogenarian fatigue, and in fact, he revels in the melodramatic turns of first-time screenwriter kelly masterson\\'s thickly plotted script.<br /><br />the scale of the story is deceptively small as it focuses on the moral compromises that unravel in a family where two brothers have become desperate for immediate cash. woody allen followed a similar fraternal dynamic in his last film, the oddly pinched \"cassandra\\'s dream\", but lumet is neither pinched nor cautious in his fierce approach to this inescapable tale of ambiguity and deception. the plot revolves around a crime that was meant to be victimless. embezzling funds from his real estate company\\'s payroll to keep his neglected wife gina happy and to satisfy an expensive drug habit, smooth-talking andy is about to be exposed in an irs audit. meanwhile, his younger brother hank is a mass of post-divorce, codependent insecurities falling way behind in his alimony and child support payments.<br /><br />andy concocts a supposedly foolproof plan to rob their parents\\' suburban jewelry store while neither of them is supposed to be there. the goal was for the brothers to collect the haul, and the parents to claim the insurance. murphy\\'s law intervenes in every possible way starting with andy pressuring hank to do the job himself. after some brotherly cajoling, hank agrees to it, but too scared to do it alone, he recruits a reckless, gun-toting busboy to handle the robbery. by fate, the heist occurs on the one day that andy and hank\\'s mother is opening the shop, and things quickly spiral out of control from there. although the back-and-forth storytelling technique is not new (for example, alejandro gonzález iñárritu\\'s \"21 grams\"), masterson\\'s approach works effectively in delineating certain events from multiple perspectives so that you understand how each character is led to the repercussions of the unfortunate event.<br /><br />the acting is pitch-perfect starting with hoffman\\'s riveting performance as andy, a machiavellian reptile whose cool exterior and innate amorality mask layers of resentment toward his family. i thought he was great in tamara jenkins\\' \"the savages\", but he is even better here. lumet even draws a solid performance from the usually insufferable ethan hawke as hank, imbuing him with the emasculated weakness that informs his every ill-planned move. as their embattled father, albert finney acts with his typical late-career bluster, but he provides the necessary foundation for the oedipal-level complexities. marisa tomei is a smart choice to play gina, as the actress economically keys in on the responsive, watchful nature of a small but pivotal role. the estimable theater veteran rosemary harris (now better known as peter parker\\'s aunt in the \"spider-man\" trilogy) has precious little time as the mother, as does amy ryan as hank\\'s bitter ex-wife.<br /><br />there are scenes that border on excessive, especially as the situation becomes increasingly desperate for the brothers, but the principals inject such energetic brio to them that the flourishes become forgivable. after the disappointment of the cartoonish \"find me guilty\", it is refreshing to see lumet in peak form here. the 2008 dvd offers terrifically informative commentary from lumet, hoffman and hawke, all of whom converse with ease and insight throughout. along with the original theatrical trailer, there is also a better-than-average 24-minute featurette, \"directed by sidney lumet: how the devil was made\", which features on-set footage and snippets of interviews with lumet, two of the producers and the principal actors.\\n',\n",

       " 'when i found the movie in the schedule for christmas, its title did not sound familiar to me since i have not read the novel and had not heard anything about the film. yet, having read the content, i decided to spend my christmas evening on watching the movie. the effect surprised me totally: i do not remember when i last saw a film in which every single moment involved me. a vow to cherish is, without any doubt, one of the movies that now constitutes a real surprise i have received from cinema. here are some arguments of mine why i consider this film a highly underrated piece of good cinema. <br /><br />first, the entire content is particularly educational. it has something to offer to the modern audience - pure right faith and some answers for the universal questions. is there a need for christ in our times? does love still matter? what for is there faith? what is the logics of burden and suffering in life? is there really someone by my side i can always trust? the movie provides the answers through the content since all that happens to the characters may as well happen to any of us.<br /><br />second, the movie is exceptionally humane. the main characters experience inner struggles and cope with extremely hard decisions. is it better for kyle david denman) and teri (megan paul) to start their own lives and forget about the family or retain the values they were taught at home? is it better for john (ken howard) to leave ellen (barbara babcock), his sick wife, and start a new happy life with julia (donna bullock), a woman he falls in love with? in fact, ellen no longer recognizes him... yet, he decides to vow his wife eternal fidelity. had john\\'s rebellious brother, phil (d. david morin), better go on his easy life although it does not bring him satisfaction or once start to think seriously of his life. phil\\'s prayer to god in the park is a psychological masterwork of universal aspect of humanity. these words could be as well said by everybody no matter of where, when or how they live.<br /><br />third, the movie is a great portrayal of family, not very popular nowadays: there are problems, yet, there is always something more powerful that gets these people together. this \"something\" is love and trust. i know that it may seem a bit idealistic. not all families can rely on fidelity and it may not be as simple as that. nevertheless, it is a very educational aspect and a realistic one.<br /><br />fourth, the entire film focuses on people\\'s mutual help. if we want to live happy lives in our society, we must understand one thing: we have to help one another. alexander (ossie davis) is an example of such attitude. at the beginning of the movie, we see him talk to john about praying. later, he helps his brother. alexander is a kinda \"angel\" that is sent to john and his family. isn\\'t it possible that we may become angels to one another?<br /><br />fifth, the artistic features are also worth attention. performances: barbara babcock gives an authentic performance as ellen and although she has a difficult role, she does a perfect job. consider, for instance, the moment she appears at school and badly wants to teach again. ken howard is also memorable as the faithful husband. picture: the most memorable for me was the scene of john and ellen in the park walking on the fallen leaves (autumn) while the sunshine (love) spreads everywhere. i interpreted as a sort of symbol: even if there is sorrow, this can always be illuminated by light and joy...<br /><br />a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie that realistically showed to me what it means to love, what fidelity is as well it once again proved to me how beautiful it is to live and believe. at the end, i would like to quote the profound words from the movie i found very touching and hope you will also do <br /><br />kyle to his uncle phil: yes, he (john brighton) lives according to the bible. but nobody forces you to do so. yet, according to what rules do you live?\\n',\n",

       " 'i wasn\\'t born until 4 years after this wonderful show first aired but luckily i managed to catch the reruns of the mid 90\\'s and the rest is history......i was hooked. the premise was pretty simple; two hardened nemesis agents, richard barrett and craig stirling ( william gaunt and stuart damon) are partnered up with an expert (if not young) doctor and biologist (sharron macready) to head behind the bamboo curtain to retrieve a dangerous biological agent from being used by red china. whilst making their escape, their plane is hit by machine gun fire and they crash in the heart of the himalayas where their lives are saved by a mysterious and previously undiscovered civilisation who heal and enhance the senses of the trio, thus setting the scene for many exciting adventures to come...<br /><br />the series lasted for 30 hour long episodes and i guess it was its relatively short lived, one season run that has set it up for cult status.<br /><br />monty berman, the producer, was notorious for making things as cheaply as possible and sometimes the show suffered for this with incredibly tacky sets - particularly in episodes such as \"happening\" ( a studio deputising for the australian outback) and the \\'snow\\' sets of \"operation deep freeze\" and \"the beginning\" but if you can get past this, and focus on the characters and the story lines, the show was really a lot of fun. it had a great mix of adventure, and plenty of deadpan humour (mainly from some terrific one liners from william gaunt).<br /><br />the chemistry from the three leads was fantastic - you get the sense that they were really having a lot of fun making the show and this is borne out in the 2005 reunion documentary where the three reunite after over 35 years to reminisce about the show (and laugh about anthony nicholls awful wig!!). they all shared equal screen time and all had their moments to shine. i have to say, i was always a richard barrett fan - i loved his sardonic humour along with that dangerous edge - he was certainly a man you didn\\'t cross, and those eyes........the bluest eyes you would probably see on tv. i have also followed bill gaunts career with interest since. however, craig stirling certainly would have had his legion of female fans and i am sure alexandra bastedo had a whole queue of male fans swooning over her too.<br /><br />the show also had a plethora of guest stars to entice with, including donald sutherland, jeremy brett, peter wyngarde, burt kwouk, anton rodgers, kate o\\'mara, jenny linden, paul eddington and colin blakely.<br /><br />notable episodes for me were : \"auto kill\", \"the interrogation\", \"the fanatics\", \"the mission\" and \"the gilded cage\" but i am sure every one has their personal favourites.<br /><br />if you do get a chance to watch this show for the first time, or to re watch it after many years, remember to watch it in the context of the time it was made and just sit back and enjoy - the characters and the chemistry from the three leads is what made this wonderful show for me and i don\\'t think i will ever tire of it.<br /><br />enjoy!\\n',\n",

       " 'obviously, i didn\\'t care for things to come (aka \"the shape of things to come\") as much as most viewers. that means that there is a good chance that you\\'ll enjoy it more than i did. at any rate, you might find it useful to hear the film described from another point of view.<br /><br />directed by william cameron menzies, who had as much experience as a production designer and even more as an art director, this is a film adaptation by h.g. wells of his own novel by the same name. in my eyes, it helps demonstrate why a great novelist may not necessarily turn out to be a great screenwriter.<br /><br />the film opens in 1940 in a london-like \"everytown\". war is brewing and the citizens of everytown are worried that it might reach them. it does. and it turns into a decades-long affair that basically destroys civilization. wells and menzies keep jumping forward in time to show us different scenes related to the war and its aftermath. we see two pilots, one downed, coming to terms with the consequences of their fighting. we meet a post-apocalyptic community ruled over by a would-be warlord. we meet a man from a burgeoning futuristic society. we see the way that technology is changing. and finally, we\\'re taken to the full realization of that futuristic society circa 2036, where the leaders are debating the merits of sending man to the moon.<br /><br />that might all sound potentially very exciting, but it just does not work as a film. structurally, the film is far too episodic, with little to dramatically tie it together. by the third segment, i completely lost interest in trying to keep track of the characters. i had barely been able to sort them out in the first couple segments. there\\'s a constant parade of new faces. we don\\'t get to learn anything about any of them.<br /><br />it doesn\\'t help that the individual segments, with a couple exceptions, tend to be awkwardly directed and edited. they are also occasionally manipulative--it can almost begin to feel like a propaganda film. but maybe contradictorily, the segments are also a bit cold and dry emotionally.<br /><br />in fact, one overlong section is more like a music video/industrial promotional video. if features shots of building the futuristic city, with lots of large machinery, lots of welding, and so on. at one point, a guy who looks like an astronaut waves at the camera through some kind of futuristic glass. the music for this section is somewhere between militaristic and an overblown horror score. i can\\'t say that things to come consists of engaging material in terms of drama.<br /><br />but the common cry in support of things to come is that it is \"a film about ideas\". that may be true, but there are a couple problems with it if looked at that way. one, it still doesn\\'t make it work _as a film_, that is, as a visual and aural dramatic artwork, and two, there are far too many ideas presented here.<br /><br />the principle idea is that of war and what it does to civilizations. that\\'s a fine thing to make a film about. it\\'s also remarkably prescient of world war ii, as the things to come was scripted and filmed in 1935 (released in 1936). wells has some interesting things to say about war, some of which go against the usual interpretation of the film. for example, the ending seems to suggest that another war is breaking out, or will at any moment. the overall message seems a trifle pessimistic. wells seems to be showing that war is simply a part of human nature that cannot be excised, although it doesn\\'t preclude \"progress\"--in fact, maybe it fuels progress, at least indirectly.<br /><br />that would certainly be enough for one film. however, there are many more ideas here. the scene between the two pilots is one of the more poignant scenes of the film. it deals with a complex dilemma. one pilot has shot the other down, but is now coming to assist him. but the pilot who was shot down was carrying a poisonous gas that is now billowing across the field. they can\\'t both breathe the gas without harm. a girl comes along. they only have two functioning gas-masks between them. the pilot who was shot down offers his mask, as he says he\\'s dying anyway. what to do? it\\'s not that this scene itself could be stretched out to feature length, but the ideas--the bizarre complex of both helping and trying to hurt each other in the midst of a war--are enough to build a film on.<br /><br />another example. during the scenes featuring the would-be warlord, in the post-apocalyptic environment, there is a nasty contagious disease called the \"wandering sickness\" going around. it turns victims into something like drunken zombies. the usual procedure is to shoot victims on site in an attempt to stave off the disease. this material is dealt with as if it were an afterthought. it\\'s a great idea and deserved its own film.<br /><br />similarly, wells presents the future society as having controversial socialist ideas. that was enough for its own film, too. it\\'s just impossible to effectively deal with so much stuff in 100 minutes, especially when it\\'s supposed to be the crux of the film in lieu of dramatic attraction.<br /><br />still, there are reasons to give things to come at least one viewing. if you\\'re at all a sci-fi buff, this is a historically important film. given menzies\\' background, the production and set designs are interesting, even if the cinematography seems extremely dated. it\\'s also interesting to see how wells was either prescient or retrospectively humorous in his \"predictions\". i particularly enjoyed the means of propulsion to the moon, which was strongly reminiscent of george méliès\\' 1902 a trip to the moon (aka le voyage dans la lune). just don\\'t expect too much from things to come.\\n',\n",

       " 'a few days ago, i watched a documentary called the fifty worst movies of all time and this is where i first heard of the incredible melting man. being a lover of schlocky films, i am making it a point to try to find some of the films from the documentary--not just including the incredible melting man. in fact, melting man is the first \"bad film\" i have seen since then and i must say i am rather disappointed. while it truly is a bad film, it comes nowhere near close enough to make inclusion on this list.<br /><br />now before seeing the documentary, i have enjoyed \"bad films\" ever since i read the book \"the fifty worst movies of all time\" by harry medved. despite the same title, the book came out long, long before the documentary and the makers of the documentary never credited medved with the concept. from the medved book, i have seen about 35 of the 50 films but have come to an impasse--the rest of the films just aren\\'t available on vhs or dvd. so, i thought i\\'d try the film by the same name.<br /><br />the reason i was most disappointed with the incredible melting man was that there were a few good elements to the film. first, the melting guy special effects were generally really cool and disgusting. it\\'s obvious that a professional (the famous rich baker) was involved in making this look realistic. however, i should also point out that there were also more than a few cheap and cheesy effects as well--such as the floating plastic head and the way the monster ran around after his left arm was cut off--you could see it \"cleverly hidden\" under his clothes! as for the story, it\\'s just stupid. a group of astronauts miraculously penetrate the rings of saturn without being crushed. then, they comment about how beautiful the sun is--as we see closeups of it. this is odd since saturn is so far from it--it should not look this way--it should be a large speck. regardless, immediately the scene changes and we\\'re told that one of the surviving astronauts is in a hospital. what happened between the last scene and this one? yep, it\\'s anyone\\'s guess. well, soon after, the survivor escapes and engages in a murderous rampage as his entire body melts.<br /><br />now considering they have a psycho running about who looks like a melting popsicle, you\\'d think the government would pull out all stops to find and stop him, right?! wrong. a general engages one lone doctor to find him!! no army, no police--just some dopey doctor. even after bodies begin stacking up, at no point do the doctor or general do anything to organize a meaningful search or get backup.<br /><br />now, given the stupidity of the film, you also wouldn\\'t be surprised to find the following: <br /><br />when the melting dude is running around near the doctor\\'s house, the doctor gives his wife a powerful sedative and leaves her in the house.<br /><br />when a cute old couple is driving late at night, they naturally stop in an orchard to pick fruit and are killed.<br /><br />when a lady sees melting dude, she barricades the door to protect herself. this would be smart if she didn\\'t have the back door of the house next to her! instead of just leaving the house and escaping, she just waits! <br /><br />when a photographer and his model are taking snapshots, the guy grabs his assistant and yanks off her top. why? well to give the audience a cheap thrill and make it a rated r flick.<br /><br />when the melting dude is finally located and the sheriff has a clear shot at him, the doctor stops him--even though by now the monster had killed about a half dozen people.<br /><br />so, as you can see the film abounds with stupid plot elements. it is a very bad film. but, given the occasionally good special effects, it just wasn\\'t a horrible film like i\\'d hoped. sure, it\\'s good for a laugh, but no where near plan 9 from outer space in badness and never should have been included on anyone\\'s worst film list.\\n',\n",

       " 'the past few months i have collected voyager seasons 4 to 7 on dvd (i only had 1 to 3 on video before that, because kes is my favourite character) and have just reached the end. i saw them when they were originally shown on tv here in the uk but had forgotten most of it. am i satisfied with the ending? i think i am. naturally as i fan i would have liked to have seen more about what happened to the characters when they got home but that\\'s left to our imagination. in many ways \"endgame\" is similar to next gen\\'s \"all good things\\x85\" the involvement of the crew in the future, but mainly the captain. a new romance starting in the finale (troi and worf in next gen and seven of nine and chakotay here), which results in death in the future. i truly loved \"endgame,\" fair to all characters, neelix appears although he left the ship two episodes earlier. b\\'elanna gives birth to her daughter with loving husband tom. tuvok is ill but returning home means he can be cured. harry has always been the most anxious and determined but admits the journey is important. the doctor, in the future, is well respected by all and finally chooses the name joe! but of course the captain has the largest role, meeting her future self who wants to get the crew home earlier to prevent casualties. the borg are involved, as they have played a massive part in this period of voyager. alice krige plays the borg queen again fantastically, just her voice and acting method are magnificent. i feel sorry for susanna thompson though, the tv borg queen replaced by the movie borg queen. maybe she wasn\\'t available though. the special effects are fantastic, the borg sub space hub and the borg queen falling apart! it\\'s very tense. especially when they come out of the borg subspace corridor and say their location is right where they thought they\\'d be after they\\'d said they\\'d have to go in a corridor that leads back to the delta quadrant. and what a wonderful idea to get inside a borg sphere for protection, on the dvd special features they say it was like the trojan horse. voyager could have continued. if it was more popular they would have stuck with their original idea of the crew realising the ship is their home, like in harry\\'s speech and what tom said because his wife and child are there. and then they could have got home in a film!<br /><br />overall, voyager was a bit hit and miss. the sixth season seemed to be one good one followed by one less than good one. the two episodes set in the holographic irish village are horrible! my perception of seven of nine was that she took over, it all revolved around her, which wasn\\'t true. when she first appeared, season 4 was focused on her for too many of the episodes but it evened out after that. and her character is ingenious at times, 20 years as a borg drone gradually rediscovering her humanity. i like her, especially in \"someone to watch over me,\" \"imperfection,\" and \"human error.\" when naomi wildman was scared of her initially but then became her friend often by her side, that was lovely. chakotay became my least favourite character. gone was the chemistry with janeway (will they/won\\'t they?) and you\\'d never think he was first officer, he\\'s completely pushed aside most of the time. i loved seeing tom and b\\'elanna\\'s relationship blossom against the odds. i always liked neelix a lot. tuvok was good at times, especially when he lost his logic, gained emotion and was friends with neelix. harry was annoying at times but a okay character at other times. the doctor is probably my favourite, seeing how far he comes and comedy situations he creates (\"tinker, tenor, doctor, spy\" is fantastic!). janeway is my favourite captain of any series and you can tell kate mulgrew is really enjoying it. <br /><br />i wish there was more, i love voyager!\\n',\n",
       " 'in a nutshell: this is a cookie cutter romantic comedy that really wants and tries to be something more. it wants to be harold and maude, annie hall, the graduate. it wants to be deep and human. it has interesting camera shots, lighting, music, editing, all of which give it the feel of an important movie. the dialog is smart -- at times. there are some \"laugh out loud\" moments.<br /><br />but here\\'s what keeps it from ultimately being anything more than a formulaic late-night-cable, in-flight, time-killer: <br /><br />1. david schwimmer -- how many times can joe sad-sack puppy dog stare blankly into space with his jaw hanging open before it starts to get annoying? maybe some drool would have helped.<br /><br />2. gwenneth paltrow -- she\\'s really flat here and not just in the chest. her role is supposed to be this lively, nice, caring girl who just keeps getting herself into wrong situations, is very confused as a result, and that is why a sad-sack loser like schwimmer has any chance with her. but gwenneth plays her very dull. combine this with puppy-dog drool-face (above) and you have very little chemistry to care about.<br /><br />(i kept picturing someone else in this role -- kate hudson for example.) <br /><br />3. the script and the plot -- the stuff that happens just basically doesn\\'t ring true; all the problems get wrapped up in the end with such a neat and tidy bow on top that it seems like a whistle blew and the script writers just said \"oops, time to wrap it up, got a train to catch!\" so they pulled out the hollywood formula book, checked off all the boxes, and went home.\\n',\n",

       " 'this post may contain spoilers :<br /><br />although it was 5 years after the series ended and wb was currently working on justice league, this animated movie is a welcome addition to the video library. why? well, if mask of the phantasm compliments the first 70 episodes of batman: the animated series and subzero compliments the 15 episodes of the adventures of batman and robin, then mystery of the batwoman compliments the final 24 episodes of the gotham knights version of batman. kevin conroy once again delivers a voice over performance that is nothing short of excellence and perfection. i admit i was a bit leery when i heard about batwoman and all i could think about were the old 50\\'s comics of batman. but i was blown away by the batwoman character, her look, her costume (which i assumed inspired bruce wayne to create the costume on batman beyond)and the fact that this movie keeps you guessing who batwoman is all the way through. if you want to know who batwoman is, then buy or rent the dvd. barbara gordon makes a cameo appearance and i think the writers were trying to hint that bruce and barbara had something going on between them like they did in batman beyond. tim drake appears as robin, but his role is a small one and sadly, there is no sign of or mention of dick grayson alias nightwing, which leads me to believe he has established himself in bludhaven (his city in the comics).<br /><br />of the three suspects for batwoman, my favorite is kathy duquesne, who looks an awful lot like halle berry. kelly ripa did a great job as one of the other suspects. when it comes to the villains, i\\'m glad the penguin was one of them, but i did not like the fact that they replaced paul williams with david ogden stiers. pengy just didn\\'t sound right. same thing goes for robin. the new guy did okay, but just as i was starting to get used to matt valencia, they replaced him. it\\'s interesting to note that kevin michael richardson, who voices carlton duquesne is now the voice of the joker in \"the batman\" series. and we finally see what rupert thorne looks like revamped since he didn\\'t show up in the gotham knights episodes. the late john vernon will be missed. although i enjoyed henry silva as the voice of bane, if he had to be replaced, they got the right man in the form of hector elizondo. i only wish they could have used two face, riddler, or the scary new version of the scarecrow.<br /><br />the musical score and especially the soft sounding intro were superb. i wish that was on a soundtrack and i especially enjoyed the beautiful and talented cherie in the iceberg lounge along with her song, betcha neva. while some feel that this movie is weaker than the mask of the phantasm and subzero, i find it just as strong and enjoyable as the rest, plus like i said earlier, it\\'s a full length movie based off the gotham knights version of batman, which i think gives a good balance. i would at least recommend renting this dvd first before buying it for those who might be leery of this movie, but personally, it\\'s well worth the purchase. i give mystery of the batwoman a 9.\\n',\n",

       " 'de palma\\'s technique had hit its high maturity by the time of this film, which is a wonderful showcase of his classic techniques, though unfortunately, as with many of the films written by de palma himself, the story serves the meta more than the interests of putting forth an emotionally compelling tale. <br /><br />the story opens with a crazy scene in which angie dickinson masturbates in a shower while she looks at her husband. she is then grabbed and raped while he husband stands obliviously near\\x97-and the whole thing is revealed to be angie\\'s fantasy as he husband is pumping mindlessly away at her in bed. she has a short scene with her son, a dead ringer for harry potter, which concludes with a joke that \"she\\'ll tell grandma that he is playing with his peter.\" she then goes to her therapy session, where she complains about her dead marriage, before attempting to seduce her therapist, michael caine. he refuses, and she is hurt and feeling unattractive and unfulfilled.<br /><br />then begins a bravura 22-minute nearly wordless sequence that is perhaps the highlight of the film. among the many things de palma gleaned from hitchcock is the understanding of film as a purely visual medium of telling stories\\x85 and in typical de palma fashion, he turns this into a way to show off his formidable skill. the problem, for me, is that in this instance one begins to feel that scenes are being needlessly protracted simply to further show off the director\\'s skill. <br /><br />the sequence begins with angie at an art museum. she watches strangers, all involved in sexual or family activities, then begins to get turned on to a man sitting next to her. de palma very skillfully tells an extremely complicated narrative without a single word about angie\\'s attraction, embarrassment, retreating, and finally finding and submitting to the stranger in the back of a taxi cab, all set to a wonderfully lush score by pino donaggio, who also scored carrie.<br /><br />in the second part of the sequence angie has slept with the guy, and gets up to return to her husband. again de palma crams a ton of narrative in without a word of dialogue uttered, as angie realizes that she doesn\\'t have her panties, that her husband is already home and no doubt wondering where she is, that she has probably contracted a venereal disease, and that she has lost her engagement ring somewhere in the shuffle. it\\'s all very admirable, but one begins to feel a little strung along as we are forced to do things like take a long elevator ride down from the seventh floor, then up again, almost in real time.<br /><br />...spoilers from here on out! when angie reaches the seventh floor again, she is killed by a big woman with blond hair. the woman hacks away at her until she reaches the ground floor, when the door opens and nancy allen sees her there. there is a wonderful slow-motion sequence as nancy reaches into the elevator, angie reaches up toward her, and the killer\\'s blade is held poised to slash nancy\\'s hands. then follow some electrifying shots as nancy looks up and sees the killer in the elevators convex mirror. it\\'s all good, and by the time we have some dialogue again, you think; \"woah, that was just 22 straight minutes of purely visual narrative!\" or maybe you don\\'t, but i do.<br /><br />a younger dennis franz has a great part as a sleazy and tough new york detective who would rather that everyone else do his work for him. he interviews michael caine, making the outrageous implication (though it passes as commonplace) that angie wanted to be killed. angie\\'s son is there as well, and he hooks up with nancy, and they set about to spy on caine\\'s therapist and find out who the killer is.<br /><br />once again there is a strong tie to a hitchcock film, in this case psycho (just as obsession is a re-working of vertigo). you have a woman who we are supposed to understand is secretly a slut, who gets killed in the first 30 minutes in an enclosed space, in this case an elevator rather than a shower. then the relatives of the deceased conduct an investigation, which reveals that the killer is a man who dresses as a woman to kill. de palma even throws in a doctor at the end who explains the psychology of the whole thing. <br /><br />it is very interesting, but at the same time a viewer can begin to feel a bit jerked around, and that is my primary reservation about this film. it is definitely essential viewing and showcases some of de palma\\'s greatest setpieces, but that feeling that the story is running a solid third behind the need for de palma to show off and his somewhat unseemly sexual fantasies makes it hard to look back on this one with whole-hearted affection.<br /><br />--- check out other reviews on my website of bad and cheesy movies, cinema de merde, cinemademerde.com\\n',\n",
       " 'first, this is a review of the two disc set that came together with the \"wonderland\" dvd rental.<br /><br />the two movies included with the rental, \"wonderland\" and the johnny wadd documentary, totally obliterate the myth created by \"boogie nights\". that myth being that the characters involved in the adult movie trade were considerably more than slimy lowlifes that would do anything for money, basically denying that they were anything other than detestable self-centered whores. this is amazingly similar to what the book \"wiseguy\" and the movie \"goodfellas\" did to \"the godfather\" fable and most of the rest of the gangster romanticism lore.<br /><br />now, what irritated me most while watching these movies, and will probably irk anyone who saw and liked \"boogie nights\", is how foolish and gullible supposedly educated and sophisticated people can be. \"dirk diggler\" in \"boogie nights\" is without a doubt john holmes, who unlike \"dirk diggler\", had no redeeming quality. holmes was a criminal sociopath who abused anyone close to him, was totally consumed by his quest for self-gratification, and was without a doubt a key participant in the brutal murders on wonderland avenue in los angeles in 1981. the movie lays bare the big lie that \"boogie nights\" was, and reinforces the linda lovelace description of the cruel and pathetic business that is known as the adult film entertainment industry. this should be required viewing, both features on the \"wonderland\" dvd, for anyone who had any positive opinions on the story in the movie \"boogie nights\".\\n',\n",

       " '(only minor spoilers except as noted).<br /><br />i\\'ve enjoyed a lot of spanish cinema recently; both the actual spanish cinema of people like almodovar, and the latin american cinema of directors like del toro, whose superb \"devil\\'s backbone\", set in civil war spain, was the finest horror film of the last decade. it\\'s no surprise, then, that this film is both well-made, well-acted, and manages to sustain that distinctively different spanish atmosphere. but it\\'s also as nasty and pointless a film as one could hope not to have to see.<br /><br />what actually is the purpose of all this? we have no real idea what caused the creepy central character to embark on his killing spree, despite the fact that large amounts of narrative voice-over are drawn directly from his own narcissistic journal. in a routinely unpleasant opening sequence, set more than a decade earlier, we see the central character killing his girlfriend in a rage of jealousy and control-freakery (\"\\x85if i can\\'t have you nobody can\\x85.\"). oddly enough, that is perhaps one of the best sequences in the film, but it has no discernible relation to his subsequent killing spree, which appears completely different in both motivation and execution. what happened to him in jail to cause this change? we have no idea, though we do later discover, as an absurd sort of afterthought, that he obtained a law degree while imprisoned.<br /><br />in britain, in several of our notorious \"serial killer\" or \"sex killer\" cases, the terrible question arises; what about the wife? did she know, or suspect what was going on? this is a question that this film could have asked, and indeed the wife does begin to emerge as one of the more intriguing characters. but banally, the answer to the question is quite clearly: \"no, she didn\\'t\". even when a dramatic opportunity like this is presented on a plate, the film still manages to bungle it. all we actually get, sketched perfunctorily out at the end, is her slightly amoral preparedness to cash in on the proceeds after the event. compare this to the awful revelatory moment in ten rillington place, where christie\\'s wife says \"you know what i mean\\x85.\" thereby sealing her own fate and allowing us an appalled glimpse into unimaginable chasms of suppressed knowledge and horror.<br /><br />(major spoiler in this paragraph). in the meantime, we are supposed to believe that the killer himself is a criminal mastermind who comprehensively outwits the police, thereby securing the briefest of incarcerations in a mental hospital before being released so that he can kill again. how exactly did he achieve this? the plot gets extremely sketchy at this point; something to do with deliberately leaving certain clues for the police; but how this all works or why, or how the subsequent court case actually proceeds, remains a mystery.<br /><br />i actually don\\'t believe serial killers are like this. the silence of the lambs may be comic book stuff, but \\x96 lecter aside \\x96 it gets its serial killers right. they are deeply disturbed, deeply dysfunctional, deeply inadequate people; not the creepily charming mastermind presented here (closely related to the equally implausible suave killer of the last horror movie, or indeed even man bites dog, though it appears not to have been noticed that that was a satire).<br /><br />this film has little suspense, and bungles what little intrigue the plot might have generated. it has nothing useful to say about the motivations of serial killers, either generally, or in the specific cultural milieu of spain. this is nothing more than a poorly plotted excuse to show some pretty misogynistic violence to women. and oddly, what makes that violence even more repulsive is a certain prissy failure of nerve even in how it is presented. the soft core character of what is actually shown just makes it seem even more repellently titillatory. just one explicit shot, properly timed, would have been infinitely more shocking, and would have rendered all the rest completely unnecessary, freeing up more film time to flesh out the gaping holes in plot and characterisation. instead we just get endless shots of young women vulnerably spreadeagled on a table in their pretty but slightly revealing underwear. very, very creepy. i\\'m sorry to be rude; i love horror films, and can tolerate even the most extreme, to the extent even of worrying my partner. but i think anyone who finds this film good, or interesting, even i\\'d find myself edging away from. the purpose of a horror film is to scare you; this is just lascivious.<br /><br />it leaves a very bad taste in the mouth indeed. i have to give this film more than one star just because it\\'s competently executed, but morally it deserves none at all and should never have been made.\\n',\n",

       " 'i had lost faith in sooraj r. barjatya after the movie main prem ki deewani hoon, then a year back now i saw promos for vivah which looked good. but i didn\\'t want to waste my hard earned money watching it in cinema. when the film first came out on dvd i rented it and watched and i loved the movie and took back my words for sooraj. i just finished watching it yesterday again and this time i thought i have to review this movie. sooraj r. barjatyagot it right this time, okay i was not a huge fan of hum app ke hai kaun. but i have always loved manie pyar kiya, after manie pyar kiya to me i think vivah is barjatyas best work. i hardly ever cry in a movie but this movie made me feel like crying. if you have ever been in love before then there will be many moments that will touch you in this movie, the movie is just too sweet and will have you falling in love with it, my view a much underrated movie.<br /><br />the story of this movie you might call desi and very old times, but to me it seemed modern because the two couples which are getting an arrange marriage are aware it\\'s an old tradition. it\\'s done in present times, lots of people don\\'t believe in this arrange marriage, but i do. the journey between the engagement and wedding which will always be special and this movie shows it clearly. when prem meets poonam for the first time, they show it how it is and that\\'s reality and my parents where saying that\\'s how they got married and it showed it in a way which is so real yes people the way prem and poonam meet in this movie is how most marriages happen. it was a very sweet, you feel nervous yet excited, the song \"do ajnabe\" shows that very well. getting back to the story yes it\\'s a journey which you soon get glued to between prem and poonam (shahid kapoor and amrita rao) and there families. a twist occurs in this movie which is really good, the last 30mins you all will be reaching for the tissue box.<br /><br />what makes this film so amazing is the chemistry between prem and poonam, how they fall for each other is too sweet. simple boy and simple girl, when they first meet during and after the song \"do anjane ajnabe\" it\\'s very sweet to watch, she hardly says anything and prem does all the talking being honest with her about his past and the girl he liked and him smoking. then it leads on to them all having a family trip and then that\\'s when they really do fall for each other. it makes you just want to watch the couple and watch all the sweet moments they have. another factor is that poonam chichi is really mean to her and you feel sorry for poonam because she has been treated bad and makes you want to see her happy and when she finally finds happiness, you too start feeling happy with her the movie basically makes you fall in love with poonam more then just prem. when she finds happiness through prem you want her to stay happy and also hope nothing goes wrong because the character is shown as a sweet simple girl. which brings me to performances and amrita roa as poonam is amazing in the movie, her best work till date you will fall in love with this innocent character and root her on to find happiness. shahid kapoor as prem is amazing too, he is poonam support in the film, he is her happiness the movie, together they share an amazing chemistry and i have never seen a cuter couple since srk and kajol. if ishq vishk didn\\'t touch you to telling you how cute they are together this surely will. \"mujhe haq hai\" the song and before that is amazing chemistry they show. scenes which touched me was when prem takes poonam to his room and shows her that\\'s where they will be staying and he opens her up and they have a moment between them which is too sweet. again if you have ever been in love with someone that much these scenes you can defiantly connect to. the film is just the sweetest thing you will see ever.<br /><br />the direction is spot on, to me a good movie is basically something that can pull me in and stop me believe for this hours what is being seen here is fake and there is a camera filing them. to me this film pulled me in and for those three hours i felt really connected to the movie. the songs you will only truly like when you have seen the movie as they are songs placed in the situation after i saw the movie i been playing the songs non stop! the music is amazing, the story is simply amazing too what more can i ask for?<br /><br />what i can finally say it, rarely do we get a movie that makes us feel good, this movie after you have seen it will make you feel really good and make you want to be a better person. its basically the sweetest journey ever, its basically showing you they journey between engagement and marriage and many people say it\\'s the bestest part of your life\\x85well this movie actually shows you way do people actually say that? why do people actually say that the journey is just that amazing! watch this movie and you will find out why the journey is amazing!\\n',\n",

       " \"cry freedom is an excellent primer for those wanting an overview of apartheid's cruelty in just a couple of hours. famed director richard attenborough (gandhi) is certainly no stranger to the genre, and the collaboration of the real-life mr. and mrs. woods, the main white characters in their book and in this film, lends further authenticity to cry freedom. the video now in release actually runs a little over 2 and a half hours since 23 minutes of extra footage was inserted to make it a two part tv miniseries after the film's initial theatrical release. while the added length serves to heighten the film's forgivable flaws: uneven character development and blanket stereotyping in particular, another possible flaw (the insistence on the white characters' fate over that of the african ones) may work out as a strength. viewing crying freedom as a politically and historically educational film (as i think it should, over its artistic merits), the story is one which black africans know only too well, though the younger generation may now need to see it on film for full impact. it is the whites who have always been the film's and the book's target audience, hopefully driving them to change. now twelve years after the movie's production, cry freedom is in many ways a more interesting film to watch. almost ten years after black majority rule has been at least theorically in place, 1987's cry freedom's ideals remain by and large unrealized. it therefore remains as imperative as ever for white south africans, particularly the younger ones who have only heard of these actions to see it, and absorb the film's messages. in total contrast to american slavery and the jewish holocaust's exposure, south africans' struggles have been told by a mere two or three stories: cry freedom, cry the beloved country (ok, count it twice if you include the remake), and sarafina (did i miss one?). all three dramas also clumsily feature american and british actors in both the white and black roles. not one south african actor has played a major role, white, coloured, indian or black!). and yes i did miss another international south african drama, mandela and deklerk. though this (also highly recommended) biopic was released after black majority rule was instituted, mandela was played by a black american (sidney poitier, who also starred in the original s.a.-themed cry the beloved country), while the afrikaner deklerk was played by a (bald) very british michael caine, a good performance if you can dismiss that the very essence of afrikanerdom is vehement anti-british feelings. until local sabc tv and african films start dealing with their own legacy, cry freedom is about as authentic as you'll get. as villified as the whites (particularly the afrikaners) are portrayed in the film, any observant (non-casual) visitor to south africa even now in 1999, not to mention 1977 when cry freedom takes place, will generally find white's attitudes towards blacks restrained, even understated. looking at cry freedom in hindsight, it is amazing that reconciliation can take place at all, and it is. but cry freedom at time shows not much has really changed in many people's minds yet, and that the black africans' goal to freedom and reconciliation is still ongoing. this is why if you're a novice to the situation, cry freedom, is your best introduction.\\n\",\n",

we also have a sub-plot involving a girl and her boyfriend driving a car who stop to inspect a group of birds lying on the road... the same birds that were infected by the \\'zombie\\' smoke! <br /><br />the birds attack the boyfriend and the girl drives off to a deserted gas station to seek water. this is one of the most incredibly hilarious moments of the movie. she walks around this old dirty, rusty and obviously abandoned building where she continues to ask aloud, \"hello? is there anyone here? please, i just need some water!\" she encounters a group of zombies, one of which is chained to a wall (!) and the other is swinging a machete. after a bit of rumbling and tumbling around on the ground, she escapes but not before blowing up the gas station with her lighter.<br /><br />meanwhile, the birds attack the trailer-load of whores and one girl gets pecked and infected. they all pull up to the same motel where the original infection took place, and this is where the second most hilarious moment of the film takes place. after a matter of hours (a day at the most), the same motel is now caked in dust, has vines growing throughout it, and looks like it has been sitting derelict for years. anyway, what better place to take refuge than this particular building? needless to say, the group begins to break down as several people walk off together to get themselves stuck in an incredibly stupid situation involving a zombie attack.<br /><br />the third most hilarious moment concerns a man and a woman who explore a deserted village, of which the woman comments, \"this place is a dump!\" she then proceeds to get \\'pushed\\' off a balcony by a zombie into pirahna(?) infested water where she has her legs bitten off and turns into a zombie within seconds! meanwhile, her friend back at the motel who got pecked and infected hours earlier is still turning into a zombie!<br /><br />unfortunately, there are just too many inconsistencies in this movie that makes this movie just too stupid for words. for example, the time rate concerning infected people being \\'zombified\\' differs greatly. sometimes it takes seconds, other times it takes hours. some zombies run, others drag their feet and walk really slow. some even do kung-fu moves, while others hide under stacks of hay to surprise people. some of the zombies even talk! the funniest moment of course is the infamous \\'zombie head in the fridge\\' gag which \\'elevates\\' itself in mid-air and \\'attacks\\' a stupid man who goes looking for food. funnily enough, his girlfriend gets her throat torn out by it\\'s \\'headless\\' counter-part (lmao!).<br /><br />the biggest disappointment for me though was the lack of story-lines involving the people who are in fact killed by zombies. we never get to see them come back as zombies, in fact the only ones we do see \\'zombified\\' are the ones pecked by the birds and the one girl who gets her legs bitten off. other than that, i was at least expecting the couple who were killed in the kitchen and/or the guy who was killed on the bridge to come back as zombies. it is also amazing that these zombies only take a \\'few bites\\' and then move on to their next victim. <br /><br />the most laughable moment was of course the zombie fetus. a pregnant woman who has been infected lies on a bed in a hospital. a woman who seems to have a lot of \\'medical knowledge\\' tries to deliver the baby (!) and has her face pulled off by a zombie, before having her head pushed into the woman\\'s stomach where a hand bursts out and proceeds to rip the rest of her face off. timeless!<br /><br />as usual, all the characters are perfect stereotypes of this genre. the megalomaniacal military officer, the pathetic useless squealing women who scream to get killed, the obvious characters who are about to get killed (ie. watch for the man chasing a chicken!) i guess this movie really is a comedy. there were many laughable scenes, such as the shed that gets blown up with a hand grenade (obviously the scene where the entire budget was spent) and a climatic scene where a man screams, \"i\\'m thirsty.... thirsty for your blood!\". the costumes are really bad - the same zombies reappear throughout the course of the film, wearing the same \\'asian-like\\' clothing that may be found in a bruce lee film, and watch out for the blue 60\\'s skirt the girl at the motel is wearing when she and her boyfriend bump into the infected man.<br /><br />the end of the film leaves open the door as usual for the apocalyptic story-line. a radio dj who narrates throughout the whole movie turns out to be a zombie himself and warns his listeners about the \\'beginning of the end\\' while the two survivors take off in a helicopter. hardly \"dawn of the dead\" material if you ask me.<br /><br />regardless, this movie does deliver many laughs. the gore is minimal, and what gore there is, it is very unconvincing, let alone unimaginative. the usual mix of black blood, thick green goo oozing out of weeping sores and \\'zombie make-up\\' consisting of green moss. \"zombi 3\" makes for a good rental for a sleep-over party or a night of beer and popcorn. other than that, horror fans should stay away.<br /><br />3 out of 10\\n',\n",

       " 'no one goes to a movie like the hills have eyes 2 and expects the second coming of citizen kane. the same is true for the majority of low-rent horror flicks, especially those roger ebert has dubbed \"dead teenager movies.\" the hills have eyes 2 definitely qualifies as a dead teenager movie, only here, the teenagers have been given the superficial appearance of military trainees.<br /><br />some will argue the line \"it\\'s only a movie\" when questionable facts are raised in a movie review, but i\\'ve always been a firm believer that all good fantasy must be rooted in reality in order to be effective. in the hills have eyes 2, we\\'re to believe the main characters are military people on a training exercise, but they look and talk like high school kids camping in the desert. the dialog is awful and frequently vulgar to excess. though the films aren\\'t nearly comparable, i kept imagining these \"soldiers\" being in platoon, and shuddering with dread.<br /><br />very little about the characters evokes a soldier other than rifles and fatigues: radio transmissions are carried out like teenage phone conversations; a colonel is addresses as \"hey, asshole\" by a private. and nobody seems to have the slightest idea what to do, or any sense of command structure, when things begin to go wrong. i think of the soldiers in james cameron\\'s aliens, a film of pure fantasy, and how even those futuristic marines behaved like real soldiers despite their fantastic situations. fantasy rooted in reality.<br /><br />i try to begin watching a movie as a 5 on a scale of 10, and judge it\\'s strengths and weaknesses from there. you have to allow concessions for the material; there\\'s no way star wars is as good of a movie as the godfather, on equal terms. but both are excellent examples of their type.<br /><br />in that respect, while the hills have eyes 2 is a pretty dreadful exercise in amateur and immature writing, it\\'s only modestly worse in that regard than the typical dead teenager movie. on a technical side, the movie appears to have decent production values and is pretty well made from that perspective. scenes that are intended to shock, or which are intended to evoke urgency or suspense generally work. so, while watching the hills have eyes 2 may indeed be a fate worse than death, there are certainly far worse horror flicks in circulation.<br /><br />it\\'s worth a watch for those who enjoy this type of stuff without the usual fanboy baggage, or those who don\\'t tend towards thinking every movie they see is either the best ever or the worst ever of all time. if you don\\'t \"get\" horror, especially the dead teenager variety, you\\'re not likely to have a good time with this one.<br /><br />4/10\\n',\n",

       " \"such a joyous world has been created for us in pixar's a bug's life; we're immersed in a universe which could only be documented this enjoyably on film, but more precisely a universe which could only be documented through the world of animation. for those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer \\x96 when it's in the right hands that is \\x96 a bug's life is a warm reminder. we walk out of the film with an equally-warm feeling, and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only high-calibre film productions.<br /><br />it is only pixar's second animated feature. the sub-group of disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in 1995, with their landmark movie toy story. it was a movie which defied convention, re-invented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence. now, they return with their sophomore effort which, to be honest, draws a creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the film.<br /><br />after all, it's a film about ants. well, all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in a bug's life, but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film, as humans are the focal point in dramas, romances and so on. how can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie, let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film? surely they jest. however, we forget that in toy story, a bunch of toy-box items were able to become the grandest, most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted. the guys at pixar manage to pull off the same feat, and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin you'll probably ever encounter.<br /><br />not only are they all entirely amiable and likable \\x96 there isn't an unpleasant character in sight; even the villains are riveting characters \\x96 but they're colourful, they're eclectic, and they're idiosyncratic. and the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term, only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto a bug's life from the beginning. we shall start with our main character, and our hero. his name is flik (david foley), and his character is rather generic to say the least. out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush, beautiful ant island, he is the one considered the 'black sheep' of the clan, as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the season's harvest with his antics.<br /><br />the problem arises in the fact that the ants' harvest is for a bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by hopper (kevin spacey), who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants; when they show up to ant island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone, they go insane, for lack of a better term. hopper offers a proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his pack's hands; however, it's a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil. the cogs and clockwork in flik's mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame, and he offers to leave ant island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colony's rescue and fight off hopper and the grasshoppers.<br /><br />if you think about it, a bug's life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot line's of akira kurosawa's classic seven samurai, or the american remake the magnificent seven, in which a village of hapless but good-hearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies \\x96 one lone village-dweller goes in search for help in the big city, finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil. in a bug's life, the help comes in the form of a down-and-out circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by flik as warriors in a bar-room brawl.<br /><br />much amusement comes out of these scenes, and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs. among them are an erudite stick insect (david hyde pierce), a side-splitting obese german caterpillar by the name of heimlich and a quasi-femme fatale ladybug who's in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug (dennis hopper). it's exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs on-screen, as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact on-screen, as is the entire movie collectively.<br /><br />as i've said, much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another, which give way to a bevy of hilarious lines, wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall a dazzling movie. what makes a bug's life even better is that the film isn't restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be, although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film \\x96 the clichéd kid-friendly situations are a bit more abundant than we'd like. however, it's easy to ignore this fault, and it's incredulously easy to enjoy this film.<br /><br />although a bug's life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor, this is still a superb movie, and the start of something promising here. pixar have proved that they're not just a one-hit wonder, but instead a much-gifted and talented group of film artists in hollywood. they raise the bar endlessly, and when someone always manages to top their standards, it's only always by themselves. what more is there to say about a bug's life other than: see it; it's not quite the best which we've seen from the folks at emeryville, california, but this beats out the lot of its year \\x96 and i'll be damned if this isn't the best animated feature of 1998.<br /><br />8.5/10\\n\",\n",

       " 'an excellent example of \"cowboy noir\", as it\\'s been called, in which unemployed michael (nicolas cage) loses out on a job because he insists on being honest (he\\'s got a bum leg). with really nothing else he can do, he decides that for once he\\'s going to lie. when he walks into a bar, and the owner wayne (the late, great j.t. walsh) mistakes him for a hit-man whom wayne has hired to do in his sexy young wife suzanne (lara flynn boyle in fine form), michael plays along and accepts waynes\\' money. *then* he goes to suzanne and informs her of her husbands\\' intentions, and accepts *her* money to get rid of wayne! if that didn\\'t complicate things enough, the real hit-man, \"lyle from dallas\" (dennis hopper, in a perfect role for him) shows up and michael is in even more trouble than before.<br /><br />\"red rock west\" gets a lot out of the locations. director john dahl, who co-wrote the script with his brother rick, was smart in realizing the potential of a story set in a truly isolated small town that may have seen better days and in which the residents could be involved in any manner of schemes. it\\'s also an amusing idea of the kind of trouble an honest person could get into if they decided to abandon their principles and give in to any level of temptation. it\\'s an appreciably dark and twist-laden story with an assortment of main characters that are if not corrupt, have at least been morally compromised like michael. the lighting by cinematographer marc reshovsky is superb in its moodiness; even the climax set in a graveyard lends a nice morbid quality to the whole thing. even if the writing isn\\'t particularly \"logical or credible\", the film has a nice way of intriguing the viewer and just drawing them right in.<br /><br />cage does a good job in the lead, but his co-stars have a grand old time sinking their teeth into their meaty and greed-motivated characters. hopper, boyle, and walsh are all fun to watch in these parts. timothy carhart and dan shor are fine as walshs\\' deputies (in one especially good twist, walsh is also the local sheriff), and there\\'s an entertaining cameo role for country & western star dwight yoakam, who also graces the film with an enjoyable end credits tune.<br /><br />it\\'s quite a good little film worth checking out. it moves forward at an impressive pace, and if nothing else is certainly never boring.<br /><br />8/10\\n',\n",

'ecstasy' was considered shocking for its time... some thought it to be scandalous.<br /><br />she returns home to her father's estate and files for divorce. the next day, she wakes with a complete sense of freedom and happiness. she just has to go outside and feel the freedom of the countryside and fresh air. eva goes for a horseback ride and happens across a beautiful lake. and in one of the most famous scenes in film history, hedy lamarr became the first person to ever appear nude in a major film. her frolic in the woods and her skinny-dipping adventure in the lake were legendarily scandalous. but the audiences couldn't stay away. as with many of today's movies, the controversy made it a must-see film.<br /><br />eva's mischievous adventure introduces her to a handsome young man who helps her find her horse, who had run off with her clothes. after an awkward meeting, they eventually fall for each other. their first romantic rendezvous was almost as controversial as the nude scene, with its blatant waves of eroticism. however, machaty does beautiful work in these romantic moments. machaty creates one delightful moment, when eva literally seems to sink into her new lover, using a gorgeous early camera trick.<br /><br />it cannot be overstated how brave this performance was on lamarr's part. many might have presumed it was career suicide. instead, it gained her worldwide fame and caught the eye louis b mayer, who signed her to a contract with mgm. there are some truly erotic moments in this film, even by today's raunchy standards. it is impossible to imagine how they were received in the 1930's. again, machaty was very clever with his imagery, leaving a lot to the imagination. but we all understand very well what we are seeing and it is supremely well done.<br /><br />the meeting of eva's former husband and her current lover is perhaps inevitable. however, the consequences of that meeting are not. the film takes a few unexpected turns in its final act and it all makes for a great story and a lovely debut on the grand stage of movie stardom for hedy lamarr.<br /><br />i highly recommend this once controversial, now tame film and urge you to seek it out in its restored form on dvd. it is easily worthwhile, if only for the pleasure of seeing hedy lamarr. but the story is compelling too and the direction is ahead of its time.

       " 'i won\\'t claim to be a fan of ralph bakshi, because i am not. i have only watched 5 of his animated films so far: coonskin, wizards, fritz the cat and lord of the rings and finally \"fire and ice\". what i can claim, is that i found \"fire and ice\" to be the most enjoyable of the lot. it is a straightforward fantasy tale of swords and sorcery along the lines of conan the barbarian, but the beautiful artwork, realistic animation and lively film score effectively lends a very classic charm to this movie.<br /><br />deserving first mention, is the animation itself. i do not care what people say about rotoscoping but in my opinion ralph bakshi used that technique very effectively here. i was amazed at how realistic the movements of the characters were. the style of directing and the photo-realistic character designs made \"fire and ice\" feel more like a big budget fantasy blockbuster than a cartoon. sadly the level of art detail tends to get a little inconsistent, especially near the end of the movie. some scenes just look really flat with little to no body contour details or fabric folds and shadows on the characters.<br /><br />with realistic moving characters, realistic action would naturally follow. not only was the action well choreographed, but it was really brutal. i would be so bold as to compare the brutality of the action to live action movies like zack snyder\\'s 300. i did notice however that though there was blood shed, the blood splatters were kept to a minimum. again, a great choice by the creative team that only heightens the viewing experience by not taking things too \"over the top\".<br /><br />though i do not recognize any \"big names\" in the cast, the voice actors manage to deliver a satisfying performance; keeping the delivery of every line realistically subdued and only hamming it up in the case of the bad guys.<br /><br />did i say bad guys?? yes i did. because that is exactly what the story is about, a standard good vs evil tale. nothing really original about the story which seems to merely be a mix of pre-existing fantasy film clichés that involve scantly clad warriors and maidens. anyone looking for \"depth\" would be sorely disappointed. the characters are not given much development and some of them like nekron and darkwolf are one dimensional at best(i did however hear rumor of some deleted scenes that explains darkwolf\\'s obsession with killing nekron and his mother. scenes like that deserved full restoration and should have been included in the final cut to add a level of depth to the show). in fact, i would not be surprised to find out that the whole movie was just a \"tech demo\" of sorts to showcase the awesome animation and art, with the story cobbled together and thrown in as an afterthought in order to pass it off as a proper \"movie\".<br /><br />a true classic of a bygone era, \"fire and ice\" really captures the blazing spirit of adventure and mysticism with its beautiful renderings of fantastic creatures and charming characters. it is a unique vision of a world created by ralph bakshi and artist frank frazetta with a good measure of action and suspense. <br /><br />would it hold up to animated film standards of today? definitely not. but i urge animation fans in general to \"get off your high horse\" and give this simple but beautiful film a chance to grow on you. it is truly a gem of the 80s worth checking out.\\n',\n",

       " \"following directly from where the story left off in part one, the second half which sets about telling the inevitable downfall and much more grim side of the man's legacy is exactly as such. in direct contrast to the first feature, part two represents a shift from che the pride and glory of a revolutionised country, to che\\x97struggling liberator of a country to which he has no previous ties. the change of setting isn't just aesthetic; from the autumn and spring greys of the woodlands comes a change of tone and heart to the feature, replacing the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical, battered and bruised reality aligned to an all new struggle. yet, as che would go on to say himself\\x97such a struggle is best told exactly as that\\x97a struggle. while part one certainly helped document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquired through just that, part two takes a much more refined, callous and bleak segment of che's life and ambition, and gives it an assertive portrayal that is both poignant and tragic in a tangible, easy to grasp manner.<br /><br />while the movie's tone in some regards does stray off and differ quite drastically from part one however, there still remains that same documented approach taken a month ago that avoids melodrama and fabrication as much as possible. this somewhat distant, cold approach to telling che's story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewers off; indeed, i still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have been named after one man\\x97if anything, the entirety of che, taken as a whole, delivers a tale that goes beyond mere biography and instead documents a man's struggle alongside those who helped carry him along the way. by no means does soderbergh try to paint a humanistic portrait here akin to what hirschbiegel did with der untergang half a decade ago (excuse the ironic contrast); che is a slow moving, reserved and meditative approach to telling a history lesson that just happens to be narrated by the one man who \\x96arguably- conducted the whole thing.<br /><br />yet by moving from the lush green landscapes of cuba and retreating to the bleak, decaying backdrop of bolivia for part two, the story does inevitably take on a distinctly contrasting tone that doesn't feel too disjointed from its predecessor, but does enough to give it its own reference points. here, the basic structure of part one is echoed back\\x97there's the initial struggle, the battles, the fallen comrades and the recruiting of those to replace them, all the while we see some glimpses of the man behind the movement. yet, as anyone with the vaguest idea of the actual history behind the feature will know, part two is destined to end on a much more underwhelming, and disquieting note. this difference, in combination with the similarities to part one, make a compelling and memorable whole; by all means, both could be digested one their own (and kudos to soderbergh for achieving as such) and enjoyed as they are, but taken as one statement, che delivers exactly what it sets out to achieve.<br /><br />indeed, everything that made part one the treat that it was one month prior is still evident here from the subtle yet engrossing performances from the central cast to the slow building, realistically structured combat scenes\\x97the drama inherent to the characters on screen is just as vague and indiscernible, but with a feature such as this, part two once again proves that avoiding such elements don't necessarily hurt a film when there is enough plot and reflection on other elements to keep the viewer engaged. in fact, upon writing this review i was at odds as to whether or not to simply add a paragraph or two to my initial review for part one, and title the review as a whole, yet i felt that to do so would only serve to disillusion those who may sit down to watch the entirety of both films consecutively.<br /><br />with that said, i cannot rightfully decree whether or not che holds up to the task of engaging an audience for its sprawling four hour plus runtime, but upon viewing both segments i can at least attest to each part's ability to do just that. with a reflective, intricate screenplay combined with endlessly mesmerising photography and nuanced performances that do justice to the movie's characters without drawing attention to themselves, che part two is every bit as compelling and rewarding as its predecessor, but this time with a tragic but uplifting, reaffirming conclusion fit for the history pages of film.<br /><br />- a review by jamie robert ward (http://www.invocus.net)\\n\",\n",

       " \"really, the use of stock nature documentary of swarming bats employed by the bat people is some of the most effective ever. there are shots of teeming bats hanging from the ceilings of caves, swarming bats flying out of caves or swirling about near the mouths of caves. that alone is enough to be unsettling: imagine all of them swarming after you? and they do indeed swarm in what should have been a show-stopper sequence that happened at about the forty minute mark, a downright inappropriately hilarious sequence where a teeming swarm of bats seem to attack a police car, splattering across the windshield like bloody broken eggs. the problem is that this sequence happens about fifty minutes too late to save the film, most of which consists of one or more people running around, screaming, waving their arms about at jabbering excitedly about some poor goofball who managed to get bitten by a bat during his vacation.<br /><br />the fear is that he is coming down with rabies, which does indeed suck, so their vacation is ruined, as the plot synopsis on the top of the bat people's reference page does indeed point out. so here is an effective summary of the movie: a young couple goes on a romantic getaway which is ruined when the guy is bitten by a bat. they bravely try to stick it out but he starts raving, trying to convince those around him that it's a bit more involved than rabies, that he can't control himself, and they everyone should keep away.<br /><br />now, when some one is frothing at the mouth, covered with sweat, eyes boggling about like one of the cheaper muppets and screaming at you to get away from me, you get away from him. you don't try to give him drugs, you don't try to tell him you love him, you give the guy his space, go home, and try that scenic getaway next year.<br /><br />but no, the people in this movie all behave like morons, insist on pushing the guy to his brink, and he flips out, mutates into a part man part bat type creature, and kills a bunch of non-essential secondary characters. nothing wrong with that, but the movie forgets that it's a low budget creature feature and tries to be some sort of psychological study. instead of a monster movie, we get lots of people running around trying to get this guy to take a chill pill, and eventually he runs off into the hills looking very much more human than he should have, people insist on trying to chase him down and pay the expected price.<br /><br />the main thing wrong with the movie is that this should have happened in the first fifteen or twenty minutes, thirty tops, and the movie should have been about the guy after he had turned into a bat person, rather than about the journey there. it takes a good eighty minutes to really pick up steam on that front, with some interesting character sketches along the way involving the always entertaining michael pataki as a small town cop who's lost his moral edge, and the late paul carr as a physician friend who doesn't quite get the message.<br /><br />the movie is dreadfully boring, about fifteen minutes too long and missed the opportunity to be a nice, forgettable little creature feature about a mutant run amok like the italian horror favorite ratman, which i watched today and was sadly inspired to try this one after seeing. me and my bright ideas, though the scene with the cop car was a howler: too bad we couldn't have had another twenty minutes of that.<br /><br />3/10\\n\",\n",

       " \"anyone who visited drive-ins in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, must have seen a film or two by american international pictures, a distributor that resembled 1980s giant cannon films. wherever movie-goers ventured, aip would be right there to supply the latest en vogue titles - in the 50s came horror movies like 'voodoo woman' and 'the undead;' in the 60s were frankie avalon-annette funicello beach comedies and biker flicks like 'the glory stompers;' and into the 70s, aip churned out grindhouse-level trash like 'cannibal girls' and 'sugar hill.'<br /><br />'dillinger,' released in 1973, is one of the more 'highbrow' aip efforts that capture the true spirit of drive-in film-making; it is one of those uneven, over-the-top flicks that satisfied the masses' thirst for entertainment, craftsmanship and common sense be damned. on the whole, 'dillinger' is typical for its era: entertaining and worth a couple of hours, but certainly not memorable. heavy on action and short on both acting and historical fact, 'dillinger' was a fair effort by screenwriter-director john milius ('magnum force') but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive career.<br /><br />the 109-minute 'dillinger' - epic for aip's scope - follows the quest of fbi midwest chief melvin purvis, played by academy award winner ben johnson. purvis was the investigator who sought revenge for four fbi agents killed in a 1933 kansas city ambush that helped gangster frank nash to escape justice. at large were the men who supposedly plotted that breakout, including expert bankrobber john dillinger (warren oates), pretty boy floyd (steve kanaly), and psychopath baby face nelson (richard dreyfuss). dillinger eventually joined forces with floyd and nelson, taking along homer van meter (harry dean stanton) and harry pierpont (geoffrey lewis). he also hooked up with billie frechette (michelle phillips), a prostitute of french and indian extraction. while taking place over several months in 1933-4, 'dillinger' is basically a chase film, with purvis's entourage looking to run down and kill off the men wanted by j. edgar hoover.<br /><br />'dillinger' has a documentary feel, listing dates and places while johnson supplies loose narrative as purvis. milius keeps an honest depression look, using authentic fashion, cars, weapons, and buildings; he also sprinkles around black-and-white photography and stock footage of gangster shootouts. the film is never boring, moving at a quick, if haphazard, pace. the action scenes are dillinger's strongpoint, edited competently by fred feitshans jr in his last professional effort. thousands of blank ammunition rounds must have been used to make this film, not to mention pounds of explosives. this film is certainly not for the squeamish, with people getting shot and dropping dead all over the place. the violence, while gratuitous, brings some understanding of the mayhem that organized crime dumped on american life.<br /><br />this film never transcends its exploitation status, however, because the needed writing just isn't there. john milius, somewhat overrated as a filmmaker, places way too much emphasis on action. the action scenes (mostly blood-filled shootouts) are impressive and comparable with any major crime film of its era, including 1967's 'bonnie and clyde.' but we simply don't get to know much about dillinger and his gang members as people; the vital relationship that develops between dillinger and frechette is barely touched upon, with the pair meeting in a bar during one scene and cavorting as lovers just ten minutes afterward. melvin purvis also seems to wander in and out of the storyline, becoming a prominent figure only when milius needs to keep the film from unraveling. all too often, the film takes on a shoot-'em-up persona when its characters could have been explored in detail.<br /><br />aside from this, the picture's main crime is ignorance of historical fact. while many say that 'dillinger' is just a film, it's films such as this one that create fables and make them permanent. those with knowledge of gangster history will point out that john dillinger was not the last of his ring to die, as milius's screenplay and the film's documentary style encourage us to believe. in fact, dillinger died before baby face nelson and homer van meter; he also was said not to be carrying a gun on the night of his death, nor did he have billie frechette in tow. while these inaccuracies might make for high drama, there is no reason why milius couldn't have stayed with the facts and written a great story around them.<br /><br />warren oates's performance as dillinger is quite good, although he sometimes looks unconvincing. oates is humorous and nicely portrays how dillinger became consumed by his larger-than-life image in the american press; however, we never really feel the menace he invoked in his lifetime. ben johnson gives some life to purvis, suave but rather flat. michelle phillips brings emotion to the billie frechette character and it's really too bad that milius's screenplay didn't flesh out her relationship with dillinger. we never learn what drew her to a cold-blooded killer, other than the stereotype of an easy-going girl who is attracted to men of danger. the supporting roles with kanaly, dreyfuss, stanton, lewis, and a briefly-appearing cloris leachman, are acceptable for such talent.<br /><br />as a piece of 1970s exploitation, 'dillinger' appears doomed to retail bargain bins, which is exactly where i picked up mgm's dvd release for $4.99. the film is nicely presented in widescreen (a must for drive-in flicks) with subtitles in french and spanish. dillinger's theatrical trailer is supplied as a lone extra. largely forgotten except by gangster movie fans and drive-in enthusiasts, the film doesn't really call for much else in way of supplementary material. for fans of the genre, it's certainly worth checking out.<br /><br />** out of 4<br /><br />roving reviewer - www.geocities.com/paul_johnr\\n\",\n",

       " 'i\\'m going to write about this movie and about \"irreversible\" (the (in)famous scene in it). so you are warned, if you haven\\'t seen the movie yet. this are just my thoughts, why i think the movie fails (in the end - pun intended).<br /><br />acting wise, rosario dawson is really good and almost conveys portraying someone almost a decade younger (a teenager in other words). the villain guy is good, but loses his \"evil\" touch right before the end. if he really never changes, then why would he let a woman tie him up? he wouldn\\'t, period. then we also have the bartender/2nd rape dude. actually i don\\'t think you would need him. at least not for the 2nd rape, but more about that later on.<br /><br />let\\'s reprise the story. rosarios character is sexually insecure, might even have lesbian tendencies (see her scene with a female friend). this wasn\\'t intentional, as rosario states herself, but there is sexual tension between them. rosario\\'s character meets a guy, who is a sexual predator, in all the bad senses. but he makes an impression on her.<br /><br />rosario commented that her character had a boyfriend before. i beg to differ. because she acts, as if it is her first boyfriend, which also underlines her phone conversation with her mother. talking about her mother, here\\'s another problem. after the first rape takes place, rosarios character doesn\\'t tell anyone what happened. seiing that her relationship with her mother is a very close one, nothing of that gets explored after that. if rosarios character wouldn\\'t call her mother anymore or would behave strangely, the mother would be worried like crazy. there was so much potential here. also her female friend: we see her at the party, it\\'s obvious there is something going on and \"boom\" she is gone.<br /><br />the first rape is almost unbearable to watch. but feels like a pinch, when you compare it to the ending (rape), which feels like you\\'re getting hit with a sledge hammer! after rape no. 1 we get too stretched out scenes. threads are opened (such as her construction work is an indication that she might be lesbian, as one guy states who tried to hit on her ...), but left in the open. no real social contact is established, if you leave the bartender guy out, who is involved in the 2nd and last rape scene. it\\'s apparent that he isn\\'t a \"nice\" guy and his character get\\'s fleshed out a bit. but when rosarios character meets her rapist in class again, his being in the movie seems pointless. we get the point that rosarios character isn\\'t the same anymore, that she went \"bad\" and is able to hurt people. (too) many scenes show exactly that, her being without emotion just doing drugs and other stuff. back to rapist #1 who cheats on a test, gets caught by rosarios character and they decide to hang out together again (really?). as absurd as that sounds, the guy meets up with her, not without us having seen him beforehand, with another girl (very likely that he raped her too, although we never see anything of that, fortunately) and his football career. well career is a stretch and he is bullied. this is an attempt to give his character some depth and it almost works, but then again is too cliché to stay with you. so rapist #1 submits to rosarios character ... why exactly? because he promised her, it was her day? again, really? a guy like that never loses control, especially with a woman he raped before ... i guess this is supposed to show us how stupid he is. the bartender guy would have worked as someone who could have hit him over the head or something, but letting him submit like that, just feels wrong. another possibility would have a drug in his drink.<br /><br />so rapist #1 undresses and get\\'s blindfolded and let\\'s rosarios character tie him on a bed .... seriously, that\\'s just crazy! but what comes next, is even crazier. first she talks to him, then she \"shuts\" him up and forces an object into him. this is as difficult to watch as rape scene number one. this isn\\'t about what this guy deserves or not, it\\'s just intense. and of course that was what they were aiming for. now after she is \"done\" the bartender guy comes in and rapes ... rapist #1. if this really should work as a revenge movie, it would have been better if rosarios character herself would have been doing all the \"revenge\". having a henchman doing the job, takes away everything that was built up.<br /><br />this isn\\'t supposed to be entertaining/enjoyable, it\\'s a hard watch & it is art-house. but the 10 minute (i didn\\'t count ) rape scene at the end, just smashes everything. rosarios character is more or less, only watching what happens. which brings me to the biggest disappointment.<br /><br />irreversible comparison: \"irreversible\" had the rape scene, but the movie went on (even if it was back into time). rosario is looking into the camera in the end and says something about having to get over this. first, that comes a bit too late, that should see her say that after the initial rape. and secondly and most importantly, this is where the art-house movie should\\'ve come in. it is more interesting seeing were rosarios character would go after the second rape scene and how she would cope, with what she had done. but then again, she didn\\'t actually physically do that much (see above) ... a broken character that the movie cuts off ...<br /><br />good intentions (talia and rosario had worked before), but failing to convey most of the things, they set out to do (even if you can see what they meant, it has to be convincing, otherwise it doesn\\'t work) ... not to mention the overlong rape scenes as they are ...\\n',\n",
       " 'there are two groups of people...those who love every fellini movie they see and normal people. while i will admit that i have really enjoyed some of his films, i can also honestly say that i can\\'t stand some of them. my opinion, by the way, is not just some knee-jerk reaction--i have seen most of fellini\\'s films and have also seen many films by the world\\'s most famous directors. with this in mind, i feel that the most overrated and annoying directors can be both godard and fellini. they both have delighted in the bizarre and often unwatchable and yet have received gobs of accolades from reviewers and the \"intelligensia\", while the average person would never sit through some of their films. heck, even a person who loves international cinema would generally be left out in the cold when seeing some of these films. so, since only a small clique actually watches their films and they are already predisposed to seeing the directors as geniuses, it\\'s not surprising that their films are so often praised--it\\'s like a cult! if you don\\'t believe me, think about many of godard\\'s films such as first name carmen or alphaville,...or what about fellini satyricon or juliet of the spirits? these films abound with boredom, weirdness and incomprehensibility. now i am not saying a film can\\'t be weird (after all i love happiness of the katakuris and shaolin soccer), but it must be watchable!<br /><br />now on to this movie. somehow, fellini has managed to make a story about a sexually compulsive man completely boring and unsexy. this is no small task--it took a lot of work to make this so unwatchable. instead of cheap sexual thrills, the sex acts are choreographed in a silly and annoying way while the character of casanova is buried under so much makeup and prosthetics that donald sutherland looks like a ghoul. i know some of this must have been fellini\\'s intention, but many viewers will be left completely bored by this sterile performance--especially since sutherland\\'s lines are all poorly dubbed into italian and so he neither looks nor sounds like himself! unfortunately, when the movie is not wrapped up in these boring sexual escapades, there really isn\\'t anything else to watch.<br /><br />an interesting note about the first sexual conquest shown in this dull movie is that the actress looks amazingly like a younger version of fellini\\'s wife, giulietta masina. considering that in addition to this, that in previous decades fellini had masina play characters such as a prostitute and a horribly abused woman, it seems like he may have truly hated his wife and was having this acted out on screen. i read a bit about them and their tempestuous relationship and it seems to bear this out as well. this is about the only aspect of this turgid film that i found at all interesting. don\\'t say i didn\\'t warn you!\\n',\n",

       " \"its taken a few viewings for me to really wrap myself around this one, but for me tears of kali is one of the horror highlights of the 00's and as far as independent horror goes a veritable masterpiece. an anthology horror, it takes on the story of the fictional taylor-eriksson group, a cult of sorts based in india whose members set out in search of ultimate self knowledge and healing of the psyche, with unpleasant results that echo down the years. with bookend segments set in india the film is made chiefly of three stories set in germany, illustrating the aftermath of the work of the taylor-eriksson group, with some pretty nasty gore at times. its an interesting set up as these things go, but what sets this film apart is the way the imagery is so carefully set up to develop the films horror. bad things have been unleashed and the general course of the film is a look at how the quest for self knowledge and ultimate therapy brings horror to patients, healers and others and the film is loaded with smart visual clues to the power of the dark forces with which it deals, dark forces unbound by time, place or even personality. good examples of this are found in the first story especially, dealing with a journalist interviewing a lady in a mental hospital. previous to this story we have seen lars eriksson and notably his wonky (lazy?) eye, we also see him healing or at least comforting a patient. the lady mental patient of the first story is seen in the same stance as eriksson healing a fellow patient, also as she wraps up the canvases from the art class that she runs among her fellow patients one of their pictures is seen, a face with lazy eye like erikssons. there are also references to folk in minuscule roles, extras and walk ons having extra sensory perceptions of what is going on in the film, showing the badness that has been unleashed spreading and able to almost infect others. there is more to the film philosophically than just evil within, it is a film about death, suffering and possible redemption too all bound in a structure derived from hindu beliefs in a fashion that seems like it might just be exploitation but has more relation to actual beliefs than one might expect (at least from the research that i did on wikipedia). writer/director andreas marschall definitely deserves some significant credit for his skill in constructing the film. as well as being thoughtful, the film is pretty chilling too, the soundtrack of bharti india and panama john has a great eerie piano jingle and there are a couple of notable performances, michael balaun as a sinister doctor and cora chilcot as a freaky patient especially good. the third story also has a fine turn from veteran mathieu carrière as a faith healer. the biggest problem of the film is that it is not that involving a lot of the time so potential for fear is lost but these and a couple of other performances achieve involvement pretty well. so, the film isn't quite as gripping as it might be, the acting occasionally off and the pacing too, but mostly i thought it was pretty great, if a shade short of its possible brilliance. well worth a look for adventurous horror fans i think.\\n\",\n",

(so why did she rent the room -- and to horror of horrors, a much younger woman?)<br /><br />supposedly this increasingly arrogant (natch) younger woman has a mania for seizing control. and our brave 40 something must learn to fight back against this evil (and erotically hot looking, of course) 20 something. but there\\'s this problem. anytime the 20 something starts to maybe get into trouble she uses her power -- and just flirts or has sex with some guy, and escapes the consequences. (well, there actually is something to that capability of good looking 20 somethings. it just isn\\'t * generally * used in quite this sort of way.)<br /><br />the premise is moved along by the device of the 20 something conning the divorcee into formalizing their room rental deal with a written lease produced by her. of course the 40 something doesn\\'t know about these things, and the 20 something has had help. the lease actually gives the younger woman equal right to the whole house during the rental period, with utilities thrown in at the fixed price. even though an eviction proceeding is soon pending, the 20 something soon gets a temporary restraining order against the older woman, supposedly because she has been threatening the 20 something. you know, the judge is sympathetic to all the woe-is-me of the sexy sweet young thing. finally the 40 something\\'s \"heroic\" battle back for the house then begins. woopie!!<br /><br />the only realistic or perceptive thing in this movie is how horrificly easy tro\\'s (or orders of protection) are for women to get on nothing more than her unsubstantiated say so -- although they are generally only this easy against men. they are sometimes just as unjustified and just as motivated to seize control of a home as it is here. indeed, girlfriends who have moved in with their boyfriends can often get them evicted from their own homes or condos on the basis of no proof whatsoever, but only an unsubstantiated claim of threats, and sometimes without even hearing his side. even when there is a hearing, it is routinely impossible to rebut claims of threats (to prove a negative), when the burden of proof is effectively on the accused, rather than the accuser. (this is one of the only areas of american law where that is true -- and it\\'s a signal outrage of feminist overreaching, and the failure of any organized group to resist the steamroller.) of course that\\'s not likely to be the subject of any lifetime movie in this lifetime.<br /><br />the absurd basic premise of this movie relies upon the explanation that the 20 something is psychotic, and isn\\'t taking her medicine. even so it makes no sense. she isn\\'t after the successful lawyer ex-husband, though she does con his help (to the ex wife\\'s fury) in her quest. she\\'s after the house (technically, to drive the divorcee out of it during the period of the lease). this second younger woman is after all that\\'s left after the divorce, after affairs with other 20 somethings stole her husband!! (the ex-husband seems unattached and basically solicitous after his fling -- doesn\\'t matter, he still strayed!!!)<br /><br />the protagonist is good enough looking for her age. but her outlook, attitude and focus is so small minded, frumpy and utterly without imagination or life force that it\\'s impossible to care about her. well, a core group of lifetime fans care, i guess, judging by the average score the small number of raters gave it.

'deliverance's narrative is fittingly lean and sinewy, and it is surprising how quickly events unfold from point of establishment, through to crisis, and aftermath. it all takes place very quickly, which lends a sense of very real urgency to the film. the setting is established effectively through the opening credits. the characters are all well-drawn despite limited time spent on back story. we know just enough about them to know them for the kind of man they are, like them and ultimately fear for them when all goes to hell. the conflict and violence within the movie seems to erupt out of nowhere, with a frightening lack of logic. this is author james dickey's theme - that any prevailing romanticism about the nature of man's perceived inherent 'goodness' can only wilt and die when his barely suppressed animal instincts come to the fore. there are no demons or bogeymen here. the predatory hillbillies - as the film's central villains - are merely crude, terrifyingly amoral cousins of our protagonists. they shock because their evil is petty and tangible. the film has no peripheral characters. all reflect something about the weaknesses and uncertainties of urbanised homo sapiens in the latter 20th century, and all are very real and recognisable. burt reynolds is wonderful in this movie as the gung-ho and almost fatally over-confident survivalist, lewis, and it is a shame to think that he really couldn't recapture his brief moment of dramatic glory throughout the rest of his still sputtering up-and-down career ('boogie nights' excluded, perhaps). trust me, if your are not a reynolds fan, you will be impressed with his performance here. john voight is his usual effortlessly accomplished self, and ned beatty and ronny cox both make significant contributions. this is simply a great quartet of actors. to conclude, i must speculate as to if and when 'deliverance' author james dickey's 'to the white sea' will be made. for those that enjoyed (?) this film, ttws is a similarly harrowing tale of an american air force pilot's struggle for survival after being shot down over the japanese mainland during ww2. it's more of the typically bleak existentialism and primordial savagery that is dickey's trademark, but it has all the makings of a truly spectacular, poetic cinematic experience. there was the suggestion a few years ago that the coen brothers might be producing it, but that eventually came to nothing. being an avid coen-o-phile it disappoints me to think what might have been had they gotten the green light on ttws, rather than their last couple of relatively undistinguished efforts. returning to 'deliverance', it's impossible to imagine a movie of such honest, unnerving brutality being made in these times, and that is pretty shameful. we, the cinema-going public, are all the poorer for this.\\n\",\n",
       " 'in the old commercial for blank audio cassettes, the tag line was \"is it real or is it memorex?\" the same might be said for the events in this episode - a compilation and remix of \"the cage,\" the first pilot of star trek. mr. spock has cleverly commandeered the ship to take it to the forbidden planet talos iv in order to allow capt. christopher pike, his first captain who has been burned and paralyzed, to return there. why the finagling? because to have any contact at all with talos iv invites a death sentence. why this is so is never explained - that bothered me tremendously - but, if nothing else, it adds to the story. after he has gotten the ship to travel to talos iv, mr. spock turns himself in to dr. mccoy (the senior-most officer present; capt. kirk was off the ship) for arrest and says, \"the charge is mutiny, dr.; i never received orders to take over the ship.\" what follows is a court martial in which - thanks to the talosians - we learn why it was so important (besides the obvious paralysis) for capt. pike to get to talos iv even at risk of mr. spock\\'s death. the illusions the talosians create, the background music and the entire storyline are fantastic. and meg wyllie as the keeper (the head talosian) is wonderful. call me sexist but it never occurred to me to have a woman in that role but she was perfect! the talosians, having given up almost all physical activity and becoming almost completely reliant upon the power of illusion, are also unisex; you can\\'t really tell if they\\'re male or female and it really doesn\\'t matter. this episode, more than almost any other in the series, makes me hope and pray there are other worlds out there and that there are civilizations that are so far advanced! what a neat thing if this were so! this is one of my favorite episodes and, no matter how many times i\\'ve seen it (i even have it on video), it never fails to fascinate me. meg wyllie looks like an alien and i do not mean that unkindly.\\n',\n",

       " 'of all the kung-fu films made through the 70\\'s and 80\\'s this is one that has developed a real cult following. with the exception of all the films bruce lee starred in this is a film that has stood the test of time and its due to the unique story. an aging kung-fu master tells his last pupil yang tieh (sheng chiang) about five pupils he has trained in the past. all five wore masks and nobody has seen the face of each other and they have all been trained differently. their specialty in kung-fu is the name they have adopted like lizard, snake, centipede, toad and scorpion. the master called them the poison clan and he does not know what has happened to them so he wants tieh to find them and help the ones that are doing good to stop the others that are evil. an old man who was once a member of the poison clan has a map to where he has hidden a lot of money and he seems to be a target. tieh does not know what they look like so he has to mingle in society and try and figure out who they are. tieh has discovered that the snake is hung wen tung (pai wei) and along with tang sen kue (feng lu) who is the centipede they kill a family to find the map. a map is found by a mystery man who turns out to be the scorpion but know one knows who he is. a local policeman named ho yung sin (philip kwok) investigates the murders along with his partner ma chow (chien sun). sin has a friend called li ho (meng lo) who is the toad and they do know of each others identity. the snake bribes the local officials to pin the murders on li ho and while he is in prison he is tortured and killed. when sin finds out he teams up with tieh and together they go to combat tung and kue. <br /><br />this film was directed by cheh chang and he was a very special director when it came to these films. chang was not your run of the mill kung-fu director and his films always had a special quality to them. while most martial arts films deal with revenge chang did not use that as a central theme. even though there is some revenge going on later in this story this film is more complex than that. five men trained by the same master in different ways and wearing masks. then they are all in the same area and not knowing who the other is. very unique story makes this film different from all the others and most of changs stories were in a class all by themselves. i wouldn\\'t exactly put it in the same league as \"enter the dragon\" because bruce lee was a worldwide icon and the martial arts he exhibited were more authentic looking. this film still has some impossible feats like clinging to sides of walls and all the flipping through the air but this film isn\\'t necessarily about fight scenes. its more about the intrigue of the story and the characters that are involved. that alone makes this different from all the other kung-fu films. very well made with a unique story.\\n',\n",

       " 'cunningly interesting western from a director who had few peers in the genre. much like other anthony mann pictures, the far country blends a potent pot boiling story with an adroit knowing of impacting scenery. both of which play out amongst some of mann\\'s peccadilloes like honour, integrity, betrayal and of course, death! the story sees fortune hunting partners jeff webster {james stewart} and ben tatum {walter brennan} travel to oregon territory with a herd of cattle. aware of the blossoming gold-boom, they plan to make a tidy profit selling the cattle in a klondike town. arriving in skagway they find self-appointed judge mr. gannon {john mcintire} ready to meet out justice to webster on account of webster having fractured the law, all be it with honest cause, along the way. in punishment gannon takes the partners herd from them, but they steal them back and head across the canadian border to dawson-with gannon and his men in hot pursuit. here beautiful women and a meek and lawless town will fill out the destinies of all involved.<br /><br />interesting from start to finish, the far country benefits greatly from james stewart\\'s bubbling {anti} hero in waiting portrayal and mann\\'s slick direction of the tight borden chase script. the cinematography from william h. daniels is superlative, tho not done any favours by current dvd prints, and the film has a few surprises and a \"will he wont he?\" core reeling the viewers in. paying dividends on re-watches for hardened genre fans, it still remains something of an essential viewing for first timers venturing into the wonderful, yet dark, western world of anthony mann and james stewart. 8/10\\n',\n",
       " \"an overblown melodrama typical of its period (mid-1950s) and appropriate matinée food. rock hudson, the hulk everyone always falls in love with, plays his usual stereotype role, but whereas in giant, made the same year, when his material and co-stars (taylor & dean) were above average, in this movie he is just not good enough to raise the calibre beyond a mushy tale of how difficult it is to be both rich and happy. the self-destructive brother and sister (robert stack, reeling his way through the film in a drunken stupor, and dorothy malone, playing a vampish poor little rich girl totally over the top) end up the losers and hudson gets bacall - who is rather wooden in this part which does not have enough character or wit to get her going. to paraphrase oscar wilde, the good end happily and the bad unhappily, that is the meaning of fiction. however, i was interested to read that the film is based on a true story which vindicated the plot. like other films of the period, homosexuality is disguised in heterosexual terms. maybe the film could be remade: stack's character would ring truer if he was hiding homosexual feelings for mitch by marrying. todd haynes's far from heaven greatly improved on all that heaven allows , also directed by sirk. perhaps haynes could remake written on the wind and give us a truly memorable film.\\n\",\n",
       " 'ahh, talespin! what can i say that hasn\\'t already been said about this great show? nothing! this is without a doubt one of the most well-written shows i\\'ve ever encountered, live-action or animation. the newer stuff is way too dumbed down for my tastes, and some of the \"mature\" stuff i have to shoo kids out of the room for. but not talespin.<br /><br />the stories are engaging and very plausible. some of them could even be stretched out to an hour or two for a movie. episodes like stormy weather and her chance to dream are very dramatic while still being enjoyable for kids and adults alike. then there are the pure comedy episodes such as the bluest of the baloo bloods and stuck on you, where the emphasis is on hilarity. i can laugh myself to tears in a few choice ones.<br /><br />the drama aspect is very lacking in most shows nowadays(at least, those which aren\\'t specifically geared toward it), especially in cartoons. in the episode stormy weather for instance, kit cloudkicker decides that he\\'s going to join an air circus, but baloo believes that it would be too dangerous. in the biggest fight of the episode, baloo yells at kit to stay away from daring dan, to which kit screams \"no! you can\\'t tell me what to do! your\\'re *not* *my* *dad*!\" and buries his face in his pillow. the next day he leaves for the air circus. this kind of drama is a rarity in a cartoon, and would be most welcome in the ones created nowadays.<br /><br />the characters have a lot of depth to them. baloo is pretty much the way he is in the jungle book, plus or minus a few degrees of laziness. rebecca is a cunning business woman whose ideas on getting money, while good in theory, are seldom good in practice. molly is a cute little girl, but you can\\'t let that deceive you. she can be a real hellion sometimes. kit cloudkicker is a darker character than the rest. he doesn\\'t trust adults much unless they appeal to him, and he has a tendency to break off relationships. watch his expression in plunder and lightning when he grabs the grappling hook: he looks as though he\\'s prepared to put it right through a pirate.<br /><br />in the end, it\\'s the drama combined with the very real chemistry between the characters that makes this show #1 in my book. the relationship between baloo and kit is very real, almost father and son. this is demonstrated well in all\\'s whale that ends whale when baloo takes kit\\'s word for it that seymour is abusing the animals in his aquarium instead of siding with the other adults. baloo and becky\\'s relationship is also realistic, due to baloo\\'s motivation for working comes from wanting to buy back the ol\\' sea duck, not necessarily a desire to help rebecca. but something tells me that if he did get the duck back he\\'d still do jobs for rebecca.<br /><br />the sea duck, not to mention all the other planes in the series, is pretty realistically designed. the plane\\'s functions don\\'t change once throughout the series(continuity like that is hard to come by also), and unlike most other \"super-planes\" of other cartoons, it doesn\\'t have one single weapon on board(unless you count mangoes!), and relies instead on it\\'s cunning pilot\\'s great skill to get out of trouble. it\\'s hard to think of a hero vehicle that doesn\\'t have some sort of gun turret, laser cannon, or even a handgun somewhere on board. and the fact that they use their heads to get out of trouble is so hard to find in a cartoon nowadays. plus it\\'s just such a darn cool design!<br /><br />this is definitely the best cartoon. ever. period. definitely worth all ten stars!\\n',\n",
       " \"as others have noted, this should have been an excellent hammer-style film, and it seems to me that that's how most of the actors were instructed to play it... but the screenplay is so leaden, poorly paced, and filled with a lot of dull soliloquies (poor timothy dalton is saddled with most of them) that it's all too overblown and self-important. this is an uncharacteristically weak performance from dalton, although he quietly nails the climactic scene where dr. rock finally realizes what he's done. the only actor who comes off really well is patrick stewart who is a most welcome sight. freddie francis may have been a great cinematographer, but he was a lousy director.\\n\",\n",
       " \"there's a good reason that walter pidgeon is warning off leslie nielson and his crew from the relief ship, stuff he dare not dream about.<br /><br />as doctor edward morbius, pidgeon is the last survivor of an expedition that came to this planet 20 years earlier. since that time he married another member of the expedition and had a daughter, anne francis. they are the only humans left on this planet which was once the home world of an ancient civilization known as the krell.<br /><br />the records as deciphered by pidgeon indicate the krell came to a cataclysmic ending of unknown origin. the machinery they left behind is still functioning.<br /><br />maybe functioning too well as members of the relief party start dying and in a particular gruesome fashion. <br /><br />i see all kinds of speculation about a remake and this is one film not to remake because it's as fresh as it was in 1956. the terms would change, we would now say warp speed instead of hyper drive, courtesy of the enduring popularity of star trek.<br /><br />we might not see the men in the relief expedition in a flying saucer like space ship. it might look a lot more like the starship enterprise or the ship from 2001 a space odyssey. it's interesting to look at science fiction films from different generations and see how are conceptions of the future do change.<br /><br />the story behind forbidden planet is a timeless one, about mortal beings trying to play god.<br /><br />you can't write about forbidden planet without commenting on robby the robot. this mechanical marvel, put together by pidgeon with the knowledge he gained from studying the krell was quite the hit back in the day. he got a new lease on life in the sixties with the character of the robot from lost in space. his scenes with earl holliman who plays the cook on the space ship and his complying with earl's request for some home spirits are very funny.<br /><br />robby and the other special effects were nominated for an oscar, but lost to the ten commandments and the parting of the red sea. forbidden planet's bad luck to run up against a hollywood founder like cecil b. demille.<br /><br />classicists among you will recognize forbidden planet as a futuristic reworking of the tempest which when you think about it could have been shakespeare's one venture into science fiction. <br /><br />my favorite among the cast is warren stevens who's sacrifice enables leslie nielsen to learn exactly what he's dealing with.<br /><br />never miss this one whenever it's broadcast.\\n\",\n",

       " \"batman: mystery of the batwoman is the latest animated batman straight to video/dvd movie to be released. (minor spoilers ahead) the plot revolves around a new crimefighter, the batwoman, who seems to be personally involved, for whatever reason, in stopping a major arms shipment.<br /><br />although the movie is interesting enough, it's not as good as 'mask of the phantasm,' 'sub-zero,' or 'return of the joker.' the main reason being is that it doesn't give off the emotional appeal the other movies did. at the end of this movie, we don't really feel sorry for anyone as we did in the others, especially, 'sub-zero.' there is no real tragedy that made the other animated movies special for us. even the batwoman is not really a 'tragic' character (as mr. freeze or phantasm were). not only that, but batwoman's alter ego seems so incredibly 'stiff' and dull that the viewer doesn't really care what happened to her that caused her to put on the mask or what happens to her at the end and therein lies the main reason we don't get this special emotional appeal.<br /><br />don't get me wrong, i did find the movie enjoyable. it does have its moments, such as, when the audience finds out who batwoman really is and seeing an old villain return who was last seen in the original 'batman: the animated series.' the action is also very enjoyable with some very suspenseful moments.<br /><br />if the batwoman's background was more interesting, this movie would have been better than 'return of the joker' in my book, but as it is now, it's in 4th (out of 4).<br /><br />as for the animation, it's the same as the new batman adventures' cartoon from the mid to late 1990's. the score is not as memorable as the previous 3 animated batman films, but it's still good nonetheless.<br /><br />i do recommend buying this dvd because, despite its flaws, it is enjoyable. but just remember, it's not as good as the other batman animated movies.<br /><br />7/10\\n\",\n",
